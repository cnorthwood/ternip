   Xerox Corp.  has told employees in its Crum amp Forster personal insurance operations that it  is laying off about 300 people, or 25% of the staff. 

   A spokeswoman for Crum amp Forster said employees  were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines  were going  to  be centralized as a cost-cutting move. 

   She said the move would result in a after-tax charge of less than $4 million to be spread over the next three quarters. 
By comparison, for the first nine months, Xerox earned $492 million, or $4.55 a share, on revenue of $12.97 billion. 

   Earnings at Xerox's financial-services operations actually rose slightly, but that was largely because capital gains at Crum amp Forster offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up  to cover future payments. 

   Property/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent quarters, as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake  have resulted in huge payments.

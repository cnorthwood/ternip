   The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle  to form a new company  to complete most of the troubled shipyard's backlog of 15 ships. 

   The new company  will attempt  to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said. 
"The situation is that the bankruptcy court  will get out of the shipbuilding business. 
Everything  will  be taken over by the new company," said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. 

   Once its ownership  is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers  to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities. 
Subcontractors  will  be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management  is expected  to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said. 

   Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa ($23.5 million). 
Oy Waertsilae is  to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. 

   Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships  are expected  to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said. 

   Waertsilae Marine's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. Carnival, which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine, presented claims for $1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week. 

   Waertsilae Marine's bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a Helsinki court.

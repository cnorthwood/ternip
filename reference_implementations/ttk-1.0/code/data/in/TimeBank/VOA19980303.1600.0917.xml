 Nigerian security forces clashed in Lagos with anti-government
 demonstrators who  were protesting calls for military leader Sani Abacha  to run for
 president.
 Meanwhile, as VOA West Africa Correspondent Purnell Murdock
 reports, General Abacha's supporters began a two day rally in the capital,
 Abuja,  to urge him  to compete in this year's election.


 Nigeria state radio says thousands of people began gathering in the capital
 Abuja early Tuesday for the two day rally supporting General Sani Abacha's
 candidacy.
 Organizers state the two days of music, dancing, and speeches  is expected  to draw some two million people.
 But as supporters of the military leader gathered in the north, riot
 police deployed in Nigeria's southern commercial capital Lagos,  to break up a
 protest rally called by the political opposition.
 Although General Abacha had not  publicly announced his candidacy, many
 people believe an Abacha presidency is a foregone conclusion.
 Some analysts say the outcome of a face off between the police and anti Abacha
 political groups will be a test of the opposition's resolve.

 In Washington today, the Federal Aviation Administration released air
 traffic control tapes from the night the TWA Flight eight hundred went down. There's
 nothing new on why the plane exploded, but you cannot miss the moment.
 ABC's Lisa Stark has more.


 There was no hint of trouble in the last conversation between controllers
 and TWA pilot Steven Snyder


 TWA
 eight hundred climb maintain one five thousand.


 TWA's eight hundred heavy climb and maintain one five thousand leavin- three thousand.


 But a minute and a half later, a pilot from a nearby flight calls in.


 Ah, we just saw an explosion up ahead of us here
 about sixteen thousand feet or
 something like that. It just went down.


 The controller at Boston center tries to raise TWA eight hundred.


 TWA eight hundred, if you hear center, ident.


 There is no response. Later, the controller asks the Eastwind pilot for
 more details.


 Ah yes, sir. It- It just blew up in the air, and then we saw two fireballs go
 down to the, to the water, and there was a big small, ah, smoke, from ah , coming up from that.


 At one point, when it became clear controllers could not contact   the plane,
 someone said a prayer.


 TWA eight hundred, center


 I think that was him.


 I think so.


 God bless him.

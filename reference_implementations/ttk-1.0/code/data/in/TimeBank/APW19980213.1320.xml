Qantas to run daily flights between Australia and India
</HEADLINE>

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Qantas  will  almost double its flights
between Australia and India by August in the search for new markets
untouched by the crippling Asian financial crisis.
This move comes barely a month after Qantas suspended a number
of services between Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia in
the wake of the Asian economic crisis.
The airline  has  also cut all flights to South Korea.
Qantas plans daily flights between Sydney and Bombay, up from
the current four flights a week,  to boost business and tourism ties
with India, the airline announced Friday.
In a joint statement with Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson, it
said two new flights would leave Bombay on Monday and Tuesday
nights from March 30, with the third departing each Thursday from
August 6.
This  will add nearly 700 seats a week on the route.
Thomson, in India  to talk to tourism leaders, said the flights
would provide extra support to the growing tourism market.
Qantas' India manager Khursheed Lam said the airline  was working closely with the Australian Tourist Commission  to develop greater
awareness of Australia in the Indian market.
Qantas  will  also appoint a Bombay-based public relations
consultant.

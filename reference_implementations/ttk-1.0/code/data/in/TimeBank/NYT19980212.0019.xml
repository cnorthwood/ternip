NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn woman who  was watching her clothes dry in
a laundromat  was killed Thursday evening when two would-be robbers
emptied their pistols into the store, the police said.
The men appeared in the store at 469 Vermont St. in Brownsville
around 7:15 p.m., after the victim, Linda Sanders, 35,  had finished
her cleaning and  was waiting for her clothes  to dry, detectives
said.
``It looks as though they panicked,'' a detective, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said of the robbers. ``They intended  to rob
the place. There were four or five people inside, and they just started firing.''
Ms. Sanders  was hit several times and  was pronounced dead at the
scene. The other customers fled, and the police said it did not appear that anyone else was injured.
The men took no money from their victim or from the
establishment, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a Police
Department spokesman.
Victor Miranda, who lives in Ms. Sanders' apartment building at
405 Williams Ave., said the laundry machines in the building  were removed a few years ago to make room for management offices.

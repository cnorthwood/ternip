 Former savings and loan chief, Charles Keating,  is facing more legal
 troubles in California.
 A federal appeals court  has reinstated his state convictions
 for securities fraud.
 NPR's Elaine Corey has more from San Francisco.


 In nineteen ninety-one Charles Keating  was convicted in state court of
 helping  to defraud thousands of investors who bought high risk
 junk bonds sold by Keating's employees at Lincoln savings and
 loan.
 The bonds became worthless when the bankrupt thrift  was seized
 by government regulators.
 Keating's convictions  were thrown out in nineteen ninety-six on a
 technicality.
 And on that basis Keating  was released from prison before he
 was eligible for parole.
 Now the ninth US circuit court of appeals  has ruled that
 the original appeal  was flawed since it brought up issues that
 had not  been raised before.
 That means the convictions stand, a ruling likely  to send
 Keating's lawyers back to state court where they must  start over with a new appeal.

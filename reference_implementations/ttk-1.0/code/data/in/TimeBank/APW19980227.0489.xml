OAU to investigate Rwandan genocide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The Organization of African Unity
said Friday it would investigate the Hutu-organized genocide of
more than 500,000 minority Tutsis in Rwanda nearly four years ago.
Foreign ministers of member-states meeting in the Ethiopian
capital agreed to set up a seven-member panel to investigate who
shot down Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane on April 6,
1994.
The assassination touched off a murderous rampage by Hutu
security forces and civilians, who slaughtered mainly Tutsis but
also Hutus who favored reconciliation with the minority. It also
reignited the civil war.
The panel also will look at the exodus of about 2 million Rwanda
Hutus to neighboring countries where they lived in U.N.-run refugee
camps for 2 1/2 years.
The investigation will consider the role of ``internal and
external forces prior to the genocide and subsequently, and the
role of the United Nations and its agencies and the OAU before,
during and after the genocide,'' the OAU said.
The panel will be based in Addis Ababa, and will finish its
investigation within a year, it said. It is to be funded by
voluntary contributions from within and outside the continent.

<h2>The TARSQI Toolkit</h2>

<p>Release Notes and Manual for Version 1.0.

<p>Marc Verhagen, November 2007




<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>The Tarsqi Toolkit (TTK) is a set of components for extracting
temporal information from a news wire text. TTK extracts time
expressions, events, subordination links and temporal links; in
addition, it ensures consistency of temporal
information. See <a href="http://tarsqi.org">http://tarsqi.org</a> for
more general information on the TARSQI project and for descriptions of
TTK and its components. The Tarsqi Toolkit comes bundled with the
Tango annotation tool 
(<a
href="http://timeml.org/site/tango/">http://timeml.org/site/tango/</a>)
and a graphical user interface.

<a name=prereq><h3>2. Prerequisites</h3></a>


<p>The toolkit requires at least version 2.3 of Python and version 5.8
of Perl. Older Perl versions may work. The toolkit has been tested on
the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Red Hat Linux 5, with Python 2.4.3 and Perl 5.8.8
<li>Mac OS X, with Python 2.3.5 and Perl 5.8.8
</ul>

The Perl installation needs to include the <code>XML::Parser</code>
module. This is problematic for those who use OS X because the version
of Perl that is bundled with OS X does not contain
<code>XML::Parser</code>. You have several options here. One is to
download and install XML::Parser from <a
href="http://cpan.org/">CPAN</a>. Another is to install ActivePerl
from <a href="http://activestate.com/">ActiveState</a>. 

<p>
The toolkit graphical user interface requires the wxPython package.

<p>
<strong>Note to Windows users.</strong><br/> 

There currently is no neatly packaged Windows version of TTK. However,
most code is written to be cross-platform and the toolkit can be made
to run on Windows (albeit with some effort). We are currently working
on a neat package for Windows by integrating or better integrating the
part-of-speech tagger and the MaxEnt classifier. A Windows-friendly
version will be released asap.




<a name=install><h3>3. Installation</h3></a>


This is a three step process: (i) unpacking the archive, (ii)
installing the part-of-speech tagger and (iii) setting up TTK for your
platform and environment.


<h4>Downloading and Unpacking the Archive</h4> 

Unpack the archive into the desired directory. For example, on Linux,
you would need to type

<blockquote>
<code>
% gunzip -c ttk-1.0.tar.gz | tar xp
</code>
</blockquote>

This will unpack TTK into a directory named <code>ttk-1.0</code>.




<h4>Installing the Part-of-Speech Tagger</h4>

The Tarsqi toolkit is designed to work seamlessly with the IMS
TreeTagger. Download the packages needed for your platform from the <a
href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/">TreeTagger
website</a> and follow the directions. The TreeTagger needs to be
installed in

<blockquote>
<code>
ttk-1.0/code/components/preprocessing/treetagger/
</code>
</blockquote>

and this directory needs to have sub directories <code>bin</code> and
<code>lib</code>. 

<p>

Other POS taggers can be used instead of the IMS TreeTagger. The
easiest case would be a tagger that uses the same <a target=NEW
href="tagger_in.txt">input format</a> as the TreeTagger and creates
files in the same <a target=NEW href="tagger_out.txt">output
format</a>. In that case, only the <code>tag_fragment</code> method in

<blockquote>
<code>
ttk-1.0/code/components/preprocessor/wrapper.py
</code>
</blockquote>

will need to be edited according to your needs. A future version of
the toolkit will make it easier to install other taggers.



<h4>Platform-specific setup</h4>

Platform-specific setup needs to be performed by changing the working
directory to <code>ttk-1.0/code</code> and running the
<code>setup.py</code> script. The toolkit comes bundled with
classifier binaries and the setup script installs the correct
version. The only two platforms for which classifier binaries are
included are Mac OSX and Linux.

The script also makes a guess as to where to find a Perl executable
that is sufficient for TTK (that is, it includes an XML parser). In
general, it will simply use <code>perl</code> as the Perl command
unless it finds an ActivePerl distribution. This default can be
overruled by either supplying arguments to the setup script or by
editing the file <code>settings.txt</code>. The two most likely
ways to use the script are:

<blockquote>
<code>
% python setup.py platform=linux<br/>
% python setup.py platform=osx perl=/usr/local/ActivePerl-5.8/bin/perl
</code>
</blockquote>

The first example sets up the classifier for linux, and sets the Perl
path to <code>perl</code> (unless specified otherwise in
<code>settings.txt</code>). The second installs the classifier for osx
and sets the Perl path to the given value. You could also use the perl
switch to point to other non-standard perl locations. See the
documentation in <code>setup.py</code> for more details.

<p/>

A future version of TTK will have added Windows as a supported platform.



<a name=using><h3>4. Using the TARSQI Toolkit</h3></a>


To run the TARSQI Toolkit, open a terminal, change the working
directory to the <code>code</code> directory of the distribution and
type

<blockquote>
<code>
python tarsqi.py &lt;input_type&gt; [flags] &lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;<br/>
python tarsqi.py &lt;input_type&gt; [flags] &lt;indir&gt; &lt;outdir&gt;
</code>
</blockquote>


The following input types are defined:

<blockquote>

<code>simple-xml</code>

<blockquote>
An input type that should be used for default XML. It assumes that a
document contains a tag named TEXT that wraps the data that need to be
parsed and that the data have not yet been processed in any way. The
value of the tag that wraps the data can be overridden using the
content_tag flag (see below). This input type can be used for the
files in <code>code/data/in/simple-xml</code>.
</blockquote>

<code>timebank</code>

<blockquote>
This input type is very similar to <code>simple-xml</code>, the main
difference is that it activates a component that parses document
creation times for the various TimeBank formats. This input type can
be used for the files in <code>code/data/in/TimeBank</code>, which
consists of all TimeBank files with all tags (except some document
level tags) stripped out.  
</blockquote>


<code>rte3</code>

<blockquote>
Use this input type when processing pre-processed data from
<code>code/data/in/RTE3</code>, which contains data from the <a
href="http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE3/">Third Pascal
Textual Entailment Challenge</a>. 
</blockquote>

</blockquote>


Flags are feature-value pairs where the feature and value are
separated by an equals sign. The following flags are defined:


<blockquote>


<code>extension=String</code>

<blockquote>
Puts a restriction on what files are processed, this is useful when
processing an entire directory. The default is the empty string, which
matches any extension.
</blockquote>


<code>trap_errors=(True|False)</code>

<blockquote>
Determines whether errors inside of components are trapped. The
default is that errors are not trapped.
</blockquote>


<code>content_tag=String</code>

<blockquote>
Can be used to overrule the default content tag of
the input type.
</blockquote>


<code>pipeline=String</code>

<blockquote>
Can be used to overrule the default pipeline determined by the data
source identifier. A pipeline is a comma-separated string of component
names. Allowed component names are <code>PREPROCESSOR, GUTIME, EVITA,
SLINKET, S2T, BLINKER, CLASSIFIER</code> and
<code>LINK_MERGER</code>. The order of the components in the pipeline
specification is significant. Some examples are:

<blockquote>
<code>
pipeline=PREPROCESSOR,GUTIME,EVITA<br>
pipeline=SLINKET,S2T,BLINKER,CLASSIFIER,LINK_MERGER
</code>
</blockquote>

The first example instructs TTK to take a file, preprocess it and add
time expressions and events. For the second example, preprocessing,
times and events are taken for granted and only links are added. 

</blockquote>

</blockquote>



<a name=gui><h3>5. Using the Toolkit GUI</h3></a>

The Toolkit GUI can be used by typing one of

<blockquote>
<code>
% pythonw gui.py<br/>
% python gui.py
</code>
</blockquote>

Use <code>pythonw</code> when available, <code>python</code>
otherwise. In both cases the wxPython package needs to be
installed. The GUI has three advantages over using the command line
version:

<ol>
<li>It is faster when using on a file-by-file basis because all
libraries are loaded either at start-up or when the first file is processed.
<li>It is easier to use.
<li>It allows the user to type some input and see what happens.
</ol>

The main disadvantage is that it is not possible to process all files
in a directory. Here's a screen shot:

<blockquote>
<img src="gui-1.png" width="800" height="480"/>
</blockquote>

There is no separate manual for the GUI, but usage should be pretty
straightforward. Functionality can be summed up as follows:

<ul>

<li>Use "Load File" to select a file to be processed. 

<li>Use "Load Text" to type in text. This will create a file in
the <code>data/in/User</code> directory, which is then selected as the
input file.

<li>Use the"Document Type", "Trap Errors" and "Content Tag" pull-downs
and text field to enter processing options. Setting the "Document
Type" option will set the "Content Tag" text field to the default for
the document type. It will also select the default components for the
document type. The default components can be overridden by checking
and unchecking the component check boxes. Note that the three
pre-processing components are all either on or off.

<li>Use "Process File" to process the input file conform to the selected settings.

<li>Finally, "View Results" will pop up a new window that displays the
processing results in a more informative way (the large text field in
the control panel just prints the result file as is). The buttons in
the results view control what is shown in it. There are two
exceptions: (i) the "Graph" button will start the Tango annotation
tool on the results file, showing a graph of the annotation and
including a "TBox" button which displays an alternative format, and
(ii) the "TBox" button doesn't do anything yet, in the future it will
provide a more direct way to the TBox representation.

</ul>

<a name=codedocs><h3>6. Code Documentation</h3></a>

Documentation of the code is uneven: some modules are well-documented,
other have spotty and underwhelming documentation, and yet others are
not documented at all. For some modules, documentation files can be
created using the <code>pydoc</code> command. Unfortunately, this
command crashes on many of the toolkit modules.

To create browsable documentation in <code>ttk-1.0/docs/code</code> you
can use the <code>make_documentation.py</code> script:

<blockquote>
<code>
% cd ttk-1.0<br>
% python make_documentation.py 
</code>
</blockquote>

This creates an <code>index.html</code> with a list of links to all
modules. For each module, and each class and function in that module,
the documentation strings are printed. There are also links to the
source code of each function.

<a name=contact><h3>8. Contact</h3></a>


If you have problems installing the toolkit or if you want to report a
bug, please send an email to ttk-bugs@timeml.org. When reporting a
bug, please tell us what platform you're using (including Perl and
Python versions) and include a file that illustrates the errant
behavior. A database with known issues will be made available on the
web site.

<p>

Suggestions, criticisms, disappointments, feature requests and kudos
are also welcome at the above address.



<a name=future><h3>9. Future Work</h3></a>


The next major revision of the TARSQI Toolkit will be numbered 1.1 and will
be released in early 2008. Minor revisions will be released with
version number 1.0.X and will concentrate on bug fixes (as well as on
providing a non-problematic Windows version).

<p>

The following major changes to the code base are now in progress or
under consideration:


<ol>

<li>Re-implement the temporal closure code into Python and integrate it
better with the toolkit. Includes major speed optimizations (the
temporal closure components is by far the slowest component of the
toolkit and it slows down to a crawl on large documents).

<li>Re-implement GUTime in Python, splitting it into two components,
one to add the TIMEX3 tags and one to fill in the VAL field.

<li>Eliminate all remaining Perl components (glue scripts and filtering
scripts) and replace them with Python components

<li>Use standoff annotation instead of in-line XML. This would make it
much easier to deal with existing tags.

<li>Finish porting all rule types from GutenLink to Blinker

<li>Hook up the toolkit to other pre-processing components (for
example the NLTK toolkit).

<li>Add browsers and editors for the dictionaries and pattern sets.

<li>Improve on the merging code. It seems to throw away a few to many
temporal links that are considered high-precision (most notable links
between timex tags generated by Blinker).

<li>Add a <code>text</code> document type.

</ol>

A much longer list of feature requests and known bugs will be put on
the toolkit website in the near future.

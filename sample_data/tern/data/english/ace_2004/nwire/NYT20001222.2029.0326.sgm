CANADIAN MUTUAL FUND COMPANY WITHDRAWS BID FOR LARGER RIVAL

TORONTO _ Unwilling to fight a counterbid that so far is only
speculation, C.I. Fund Management Inc. has scrapped a $2.5 billion
hostile takeover attempt of a larger rival, the Mackenzie Financial
Corp., along with its hope of combining the two Toronto companies to
form Canada's largest mutual-fund empire. 

Although C.I. Fund's cash-and-stock offer, made six weeks ago, was
almost 40 percent higher than the price of Mackenzie shares on the
Toronto Stock Exchange, Mackenzie management quickly branded the
offer ``opportunistic'' and activated a poison pill, a strategy that
makes a hostile bid prohibitively expensive, to give it more time to
find other buyers. Mackenzie also told its 1,400 employees that
anyone who was fired by a new owner would receive a year's salary. 

C.I. Fund was not helped in its quest by another small fund company,
AIC Ltd. of Burlington, Ontario, which owns 24.5 percent of
Mackenzie's shares. AIC agreed that the C.I. Fund offer was
inadequate. And industry sources suggested that AIC would make a
counterbid, perhaps with the powerful Caisse de Depot et Placement
du Quebec, a $60 billion pension fund that already owns 5 percent of
Mackenzie's shares. 

Investors Group of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada's largest mutual-fund
manager, and the American Express Co. of New York were also talked
about as possible bidders. 

As the weeks went by, however, no rival bid emerged. After extending
the expiration date on its offer to 35 days from 21, a period that
brought no new developments, C.I. Fund requested a hearing before
the Ontario Securities Commission earlier this week. It wanted the
commission to dissolve Mackenzie's poison pill, arguing that it
interfered with the rights of Mackenzie's shareholders. 

On Tuesday, the day before the hearing, AIC said publicly that it
was ``evaluating'' a bid for MacKenzie along with the Caisse de
Depot. It said its friendly offer would be higher and would include
more than the $400 million in cash that C.I. Fund had offered. 

On Wednesday morning, C.I. Fund withdrew its request for the
commission hearing and on Thursday night its offer died when the
deadline for acceptance expired. William Holland, C.I. Fund's chief
executive, said his company withdrew because its first offer was the
best it could make. 

Mackenzie is almost certain to be sold over the next few weeks, and
AIC is the most likely buyer. But James Hunter, Mackenzie's chief
executive, said there were still several possible buyers and the
process of finding the best price continued. 

Over the last two years, the number of fund managers in Canada has
been trimmed by half a dozen takeovers. Smaller firms, squeezed by
comparatively high overheads, have been the most vulnerable. But
larger companies have also been put on the block as their founders
and controlling shareholders near retirement age. 

Most of the consolidation has involved domestic companies. But the
largest takeover so far was by Amvescap PLC of London, which in May
paid $1.8 billion for Canada's sixth-largest fund company, the
Trimark Financial Corp. of Toronto.

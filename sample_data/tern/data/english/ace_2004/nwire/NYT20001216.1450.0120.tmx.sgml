BOSTON _ Michael McNamara's ambulance took the call: an <TIMEX2 val="P89Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">89-year-old</TIMEX2>
woman with cancer, abdominal pain, possibly a broken hip after a
fall. Normally, McNamara, an emergency medical technician, would
have taken her to Massachusetts General Hospital, to the doctors who
care for her. But, he had to tell her, the hospital was turning down
ambulances at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-16T15:24:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="actually, as of the time of the ambulence trip, which we don't know">the moment</TIMEX2>. 

He had told several other patients the same thing <TIMEX2 val="TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="can't tell what day this is">that afternoon</TIMEX2>, he
said. And similar things on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">many other days</TIMEX2> as well. <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This year</TIMEX2>,
Massachusetts General, considered one of the country's best
hospitals, has been ``on diversion'' for <TIMEX2 val="PT45H" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about 45 hours <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every week</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>;
and on average, two of the city's emergency rooms close to
ambulances at some point <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2>. 

For <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">years</TIMEX2> it was all but unheard of in most cities for a hospital to
regularly hang out a ``No Vacancy'' sign for ambulance crews. But in
<TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent months</TIMEX2>, in cities from Boston to San Francisco, Phoenix to
Denver, it has become common, to the alarm of doctors, paramedics
and patients. 

<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-16T15:24:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> some are worrying openly that patient care is suffering because
of <TIMEX2 val="PTXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the extra minutes spent in ambulances</TIMEX2> and because of the
emergency-room crowding that causes the diversions in the first
place. 

``Virtually every major metropolitan area, and many rural areas, are
struggling with this issue,'' said Dr. Arthur Kellermann, chairman
of emergency medicine at Emory University School of Medicine.
``They're seeing eight or 10 or 12 hospitals in a major urban market
simultaneously on EMS diversion because, say, they have no inpatient
beds or critical care beds.'' 

The problem, Kellermann and other emergency doctors said, is not
only the crowding of the emergency rooms themselves; it is also the
crowding of acute-care hospital beds in general. 

A survey <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2> of more than 60 emergency department directors by
the Massachusetts College of Emergency Physicians found that more
than 80 percent of them had been forced to divert ambulances and
about 38 percent said they had seen ``adverse outcomes'' as a result
of crowding. 

But some remain cautious about declaring a crisis, among them Dr.
Dennis S. O'Leary, president of the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, an agency that certifies
hospital quality, who has said the system would ``muddle through''
the problem. In a telephone interview, O'Leary said that it still
needed to be scientifically proved that the increased diversions
were a trend and not the kind of sporadic surges that have
mysteriously appeared and disappeared before. 

Dr. Alan Woodward, chief of emergency services at Emerson Hospital
in Concord, begged to differ. ``Muddling costs lives,'' he said. He
said O'Leary ``is unaware of the problem and the magnitude to which
it's grown.''

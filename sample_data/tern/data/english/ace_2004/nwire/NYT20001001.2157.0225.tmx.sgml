The New York Times said in an editorial on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday, Oct. 2</TIMEX2>: 

<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">The new Supreme Court term</TIMEX2>, which opens <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, has no high-profile
cases to match last session's tangles over partial birth abortion,
gays in the Boy Scouts and organized prayer at high school football
games. But even shorn of the Microsoft case, <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this season</TIMEX2> will not
lack for suspense or importance. The court's docket includes cases
that, depending on their outcome, could significantly bolster or
weaken environmental protection, federal civil rights, freedom of
the press and the Fourth Amendment's shield against unreasonable
searches and seizures. 

Once again, a prime battleground will be the constitutional
allocation of power _ between the federal government and the states,
and between Congress and federal regulatory agencies. <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last term</TIMEX2>, the
court lengthened its string of regrettable 5-to-4 decisions trimming
federal authority by striking down portions of the Violence Against
Women Act and the federal law barring age discrimination in
employment. A case to be heard <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next week</TIMEX2> tests whether the
majority's constricted view of federal power extends to shielding
states from lawsuits brought by their public employees under the
Americans With Disabilities Act. In another big federalism case with
implications for the environment, the court will consider whether
Congress exceeded its Commerce Clause powers by allowing regulation
of small, intrastate wetlands to protect the habitats of migratory
birds. 

<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This term</TIMEX2> the court will also weigh a challenge to the authority of
the Environmental Protection Agency to set national standards for
air pollutants. The justices should resist this invitation to
disrupt the modern regulatory system by overturning Congress' broad
delegation of authority to the EPA or otherwise diluting the
agency's power to set ``uncompromising'' health-based standards. 

On <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>, the court begins <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the term</TIMEX2>'s review of Fourth Amendment
principles with an Indianapolis case involving the use of police
checkpoints and drug-sniffing dogs to check motorists for illicit
drugs. The court should view these law enforcement stops as an
overly aggressive leap from the sobriety checkpoints it has
previously approved to remove an immediate safety hazard. Then, on
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, the court will consider the outrageous privacy violation
committed against pregnant women who were selectively tested for
cocaine use while seeking prenatal care at a South Carolina
hospital, and subsequently arrested or threatened with arrest.
Amicus briefs from leading medical and health groups caution that
such punitive policies will drive women away from critically needed
prenatal care and treatment programs. 

<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Later this term</TIMEX2>, the court will confront a major media case. At
issue is the liability of a Pennsylvania radio station under the
federal wiretap statute for broadcasting an illegally taped cell
phone conversation between two union officials. No one accuses the
station of involvement in the taping, which was done by an anonymous
third party. Should the court override the station's First Amendment
privilege here, the chilling impact on newsgathering cannot be
overstated, much as The Times intends to argue in an amicus brief.

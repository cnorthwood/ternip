HAITI'S PRESIDENT-ELECT PLEDGES REFORMS IN A LETTER TO CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>

MIAMI _ Seeking to mend tattered relations with his opposition and
the international community, Haiti's president-elect, Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, has assured President Clinton that he is committed to a
broad range of governmental and political reforms, including a
runoff for 10 contested Senate seats that had caused an electoral
crisis. 

In a letter sent to Clinton on Wednesday and made public by the
White House on Thursday, Aristide also said he would include
opposition members in his government, consult with them in
establishing an electoral council and let the Organization of
American States monitor the human rights situation. Opposition
groups, which had boycotted the November election, recently vowed to
set up a parallel government to press Aristide after his
inauguration on Feb. 7. 

The letter appears to be an attempt not only to calm the concerns of
the current American administration, but also to reach out to the
next one. In it, the Haitian president-elect addressed a total of
eight points discussed last week with an American delegation led by
a special envoy, Anthony Lake. 

``I confirm my commitment to the points made therein,'' Aristide
said in the letter, ``confident that they will help strengthen the
ties between our two nations where democracy and peace will
flourish.'' 

Since 1994, when it sent 20,000 troops to restore Aristide to power
after he was toppled in a coup, the Clinton administration has
sought to bolster democracy in Haiti. But more recently the United
States has withheld direct aid, conditioning its resumption on free
and fair elections and progress in the fight against the drug trade. 

Describing the letter as ``a real opening,'' a senior Clinton
administration official said: ``It's up to the opposition and the
new administration whether or not they wish to pursue it. I hope
they do, because I do not see a good alternative.'' 

Another administration official said the talks last week involved no
quid pro quo, although all sides knew that a resolution of Haiti's
political quagmire could result in the release of hundreds of
millions of dollars in desperately needed aid. 

``I think Aristide is aware he has got a skeptical administration
coming into Washington and sees the need to mend fences and to at
least commit to some significant things,'' the official said. ``If
he follows through, they are very significant.'' 

The biggest stumbling block to normal relations with the United
States has been the controversy over the May 21 legislative and
local elections. Ten Senate seats were awarded to candidates of
Aristide's Lavalas party through a vote counting method later
discredited by the international community. The method gave the
Lavalas candidates a first-round victory even though the candidates
had failed to win an outright majority.

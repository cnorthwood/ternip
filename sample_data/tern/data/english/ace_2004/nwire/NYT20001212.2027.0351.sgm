A computer intruder scooped 55,000 credit card numbers this week
from Creditcards.com, a company that serves dozens of small and
medium-sized merchants, and published the information on the
Internet after unsuccessfully demanding payment to keep the data
secret. 

A spokesman for the company, Laurent Jean, said Tuesday, ``We are
aware of the issues and understand their severity, and also are in
contact with the FBI.'' The bureau confirmed that it was
investigating the incident, which was reported Tuesday by Cnet.com. 

A person close to the investigation said the intruder contacted the
company after breaking into the site on Monday, and published the
data on the Internet after a demand for money was rebuffed. 

According to the company's Web site, Creditcards.com clients include
the online fitness site Premier Solutions, Rock the Vote, Christian
Concert Authority and Spy Gate. ``We make your business go
Ka-Chingg,'' its Web site promises, referring to its main electronic
commerce product. 

The Creditcards.com case is one of several recent attempts to extort
money from Web sites by threatening to reveal their most sensitive
information. 

An online security expert said such attacks could largely be avoided
if companies kept sensitive data on computers separate from those
running their Web sites. ``Your credit card is only as secure as the
Web site it's going on,'' said the expert, B.K. DeLong of
Attrition.org, a nonprofit computer security site.

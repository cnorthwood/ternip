SPORTS COLUMN: LEMIEUX'S COMEBACK IS IRRESISTIBLE

You did not have to admire Richard Nixon, Elvis Presley or Muhammad
Ali to admit that all three staged successful comebacks. As
president of the United States, king of rock 'n' roll and
heavyweight champion of the world, they enjoyed impressive second
acts in their American lives. But each man's denouement _ one
politically scandalous, another self-destructive and the third
evoking sympathy _ lingers large in the mind. 

Mario Lemieux, the Pittsburgh hockey star, may never be a
transcendent personality like Nixon, Presley or Ali, and his future
will not necessarily include a tragic trajectory. But, despite the
initial success of Lemieux's return to the ice, it is realistic to
retain a few doubts about what will come. 

In sports terms, his closest parallel is Michael Jordan, who spent
almost two seasons away from the NBA before returning in 1995 to
lead the Chicago Bulls to three more championships. Like Jordan,
Lemieux became part-owner of a team after retirement. Unlike Jordan,
Lemieux is now both an equity investor and an employee. After 3 1/2
years of retirement, Lemieux played for the Penguins Wednesday,
contributing one goal and two assists to a 5-0 victory over Toronto. 

In so doing, Lemieux pushed the NHL into the realm of real news,
something it has not experienced since Wayne Gretzky's highly
orchestrated retirement in 1999. The Lemieux comeback story is hard
to resist because it has all the hooks. 

The first is talent. As the second-best player of the Gretzky era,
Lemieux never got the recognition he deserved. The second factor is
health. Lemieux survived Hodgkin's disease and chronic back
problems. The third element is money. Lemieux rescued his team from
bankruptcy last season by exchanging deferred salary for an
ownership stake. But the franchise still seeks new investors and a
new arena to replace the NHL's oldest rink. 

Mix in the family angle _ his young son wants to see him play!
Finally, sprinkle it generously with competitive flavoring because
Lemieux's presence could transform a mediocre, underperforming team
into a dynamic and overachieving team. The other Pittsburgh
superstar, Jaromir Jagr, admires Lemieux, who might change Jagr's
recent sulks and pouts into shouts of triumph. At the very least,
Lemieux will attract ticket buyers and television viewers to a
wintry sport that usually spins its wheels along the road to
show-business success. 

So what could be wrong with this picture? Start with health. Lemieux
says his back has never felt better. One way to change that is by
playing hockey, which punishes even young, healthy bodies. Can
Lemieux produce at a high level at age 35? Perhaps, although
crackdowns on obstruction fouls, such as this season's, tend to
weaken around mid-schedule and evaporate come playoff time. This
helped persuade Lemieux to retire the first time. 

The third caveat could be troubles, team-wide, on the ice and above
it. Despite a shrewd general manager in Craig Patrick and a loyal
fan base that understands the sport, the Pittsburgh franchise has
seemed unsteady since the Stanley Cup years of 1991 and 1992. The
market is of modest size. The new coach, Ivan Hlinka, is one of the
NHL's first from Europe, and his adjustment curve has been steep.
Should the Penguins falter as a team in the short term or as a
business in the long term, Lemieux could be vulnerable to
disappointment and even blame. A coincidence of interest in good
times might seem like a conflict during struggles. 

But who wants to dwell on the potential downside? Consider the
vibration at the Devils game against Columbus in the Meadowlands on
Wednesday night. While the Stanley Cup champions played the
expansion Blue Jackets, fans in the seats kept glancing at the
out-of-town scoreboard and murmuring about Lemieux every time the
electric sign posted another Pittsburgh goal. In the press room,
between periods, reporters gathered to watch Lemieux's televised
highlights from the Igloo. In the corridor afterward, two Columbus
assistants met. ``Did you hear about Mario?'' one asked. ``Yeah!''
his colleague replied. 

Both men were smiling, as happy about that distant development as
they were with a spunky 2-2 tie in Continental Arena. Even skeptics
and cynics look to see the bright side. It is that time of year. The
sun is turning back toward the Northern Hemisphere, shining on
winter ice as the days grow longer. Both friends and foes of the
Pittsburgh Penguins have a rooting interest in a Happy New Year for
the athlete they call le Magnifique.

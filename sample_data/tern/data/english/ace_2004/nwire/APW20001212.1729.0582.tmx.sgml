NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks were mixed <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> as anxiety about high-tech
earnings and the election deadlock resurfaced on Wall Street. 

Technology issues rose smartly <TIMEX2 val="2000-W49" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late last week</TIMEX2> after Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said he was inclined to lower interest rates
<TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early next year</TIMEX2>. High-techs also advanced <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, but investors are
too worried about poor earnings to extend the rally, analysts said. 

``There was some initial euphoria in the wake of Alan Greenspan's
clear message that he is poised to rescue the economy if it heads
toward recession, but there are still some concerns especially in
the chip sector that earnings will be disappointing,'' said Alan
Skrainka, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in
St. Louis. ``So we are seeing a shift to some of the defensive, more
stable stocks.'' 

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.91 to 10,818.71. 

Broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index was down
39.82 at 2,975.28, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was off 2.84
at 1,377.36. 

``Some people feel that 3,000 in the Nasdaq is an important level.
So, we are seeing some profit taking,'' Skrainka said. ``Clearly,
<TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-12T17:34:09" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the short-term</TIMEX2> is dominated by worries about the political situation
and <TIMEX2 val="2000-Q4" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">fourth-quarter</TIMEX2> earnings.'' 

Investors awaited a decision expected <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="or maybe this is 2000-12-11">later in the day</TIMEX2> from the U.S.
Supreme Court on whether to allow Florida to recount its election
ballots to determine whether Vice President Al Gore or Texas Gov.
George W. Bush will be president. 

Wall Street considered the protracted political uncertainty as a
reason to sell tech stocks and retreat to blue chips. 

Chip makers were mixed after Advanced Micro Devices warned <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>
that weak demand for personal computers would lead to
lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. AMD inched up 25 cents
to trade at $17.56, but Intel, which issued a similar warning <TIMEX2 val="2000-W49" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last
week</TIMEX2>, tumbled $2.38 to $35.06. 

Microsoft slid $2.19 to $55.88. Network equipment maker Cisco fell
50 cents to $54.31. 

The Dow saw big price changes and heavy trading in two of its most
well-known components. 

General Electric was significantly lower despite an upbeat outlook
delivered <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> by CEO Jack Welch to analysts. GE, which also
announced it will take a $4 billion charge for its acquisition of
Honeywell, fell $1.38 to $53.94. 

But General Motors rose $2.13 to $53.69 after the automaker
announced it will phase out its Oldsmobile division. 

So-called defensive buys traded higher. Banker J.P. Morgan soared
$3.19 to $159.94, and drug maker Johnson & Johnson rose $1.25 to
$96.88. 

Energy stocks were mixed after industry economists told the Senate
that natural gas and heating-oil prices will be high <TIMEX2 val="2001-WI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this winter</TIMEX2>.
They cited soaring demand, low inventories and forecast for colder
weather. Enron was down 81 cents at $75.69, but Exxon Mobile was up
63 cents at $86.38. 

The Russell 2000 index was down 3.84 at 483.39. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancers 4 to 3 on the New York Stock
Exchange where volume was 493.10 million shares, down from <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>'s
522.67 million.

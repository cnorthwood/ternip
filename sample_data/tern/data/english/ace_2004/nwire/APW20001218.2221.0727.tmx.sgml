Snow Spreads Throughout the Midwest 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest in a series of storms spread fresh snow across the upper
Midwest on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, closing schools and disrupting travel. 

Up to 8 inches of snow had fallen by <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-18" mod="MID" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">midday</TIMEX2> at Rockwell, Iowa, and
more than 4 inches had fallen on southern Minnesota. 

An area of low pressure area over the Midwest carried light to
moderate snow across parts of Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin,
northern Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. 

Schools and some businesses closed in parts of Nebraska. Snowplows
were pulled off the roads in northeastern Nebraska's Cuming County
during <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-18TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the morning</TIMEX2> because of hazardous driving conditions and
snowdrifts. 

Travel was discouraged in Minnesota as blowing snow cut visibility
to less than half a mile and about three dozen school districts
canceled classes. Wisconsin also had scattered school closings. 

A line of mixed precipitation trailed southward from the storm
system, spreading scattered show showers and freezing rain into
western sections of Kentucky and Tennessee. 

Farther south, scattered rain showers extended across Arkansas,
Mississippi, and Louisiana and into eastern Texas. 

Those showers were expected to move eastward into Alabama, Georgia,
and northwestern Florida during <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-18TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the night</TIMEX2>. 

Farther west, isolated snow showers were scattered over parts of
Wyoming, western South Dakota, eastern Colorado, and western
sections of Nebraska and Kansas. 

In the Northeast, a few light snow showers were scattered from
Pennsylvania across upstate New York into northern New England. 

Elsewhere, fog formed in some western parts of Washington, and
showers were expected to move into the region from the Pacific. 

<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>'s temperatures around the Lower 48 ranged from a <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-18TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">morning</TIMEX2> low
of 11 below zero at Phillips, Wis., to <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-18" mod="MID" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">midday</TIMEX2> readings of 77 at
Oceanside, Calif., and Brownsville, Texas. The lowest wind chill was
58 below at Jamestown, N.D.

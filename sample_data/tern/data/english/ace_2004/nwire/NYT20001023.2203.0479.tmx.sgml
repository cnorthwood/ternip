DEMOCRATS HAMMER AT BUSH'S TEXAS RECORD

Intensifying their assault on Gov. George W. Bush's job performance,
national and local Democratic officials fanned out to nearly 100
cities in 20 hotly contested states <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> to introduce a new video
that savages Bush's record in Texas on matters like air quality,
schools, medical care and improving living conditions for the poor. 

The <TIMEX2 val="PT10M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">10-minute</TIMEX2> tape, titled ``Texans: In Their Own Words,'' is the
latest in a series of attacks by the Democrats on Bush's <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">five years
in office</TIMEX2>. While the party appears to be counting largely on local
news outlets to convey the video's message to voters, the Democratic
Party has also been running commercials in cities like Seattle, Des
Moines, Iowa, and Tampa, Fla., to attack the governor's handling of
issues of local concern. 

The latest spots by the Bush campaign and the Republican Party,
meanwhile, take a much softer tack: In fact, two new Bush
commercials that began running <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> in many swing states merely
reiterate the governor's thoughts and ideas about education, an
issue he has promoted on television since the New Hampshire primary. 

``Parents need tools to help them protect and nurture their
families,'' Bush says in one of the new spots. In the other, he
says, ``How come the hard things don't get done? Because they're
hard. If we want to make sure no child gets left behind in America,
we need the courage to do some tough things.'' 

The Democrats' continuing emphasis on Bush's home-state record is a
reflection of a strategy of attack that has been tried in all <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-23T22:33:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2>
elections against <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-23T22:33:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">sitting</TIMEX2> or <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-23T22:33:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> governors who secure their party
nomination for president. In <TIMEX2 val="P25Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last 25 years</TIMEX2>, political analysts
say, the tactic has succeeded only once, when <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-23T22:33:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">then</TIMEX2>-Vice President
George Bush famously disparaged Michael S. Dukakis' record in
Massachusetts on pollution in Boston Harbor and shortcomings in a
state prison furlough program. 

``Every time a governor runs, the opponent attacks his record. But
three out of the last four times, the governor has won,'' Darrell
West, a political science professor at Brown University who analyzes
campaign advertising, said of similar attacks faced by Jimmy Carter,
Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. 

The sharp critiques issued by the Gore campaign and its supporters,
West said, have placed the Democrats in an unconventional position.
``There's been a role reversal in this election, because typically
the challenger goes on attack and the incumbent stays above the
fray,'' he observed. ``And here you have Gore playing the challenger
role.'' 

In its new video, the Democratic National Committee interviews
several Texans with complaints about what they say are the Bush
administration's neglectful attitudes about their problems. One
segment features the destitute hamlets, or colonias, that are home
to some of the poorest Texans. ``Governor Bush has never visited a
colonia, so to the extent that that shows how much of a priority it
is for him, may the American public decide,'' a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-23T22:33:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> colonia
resident comments. 

The Bush campaign took issue with that assertion, declaring in a
statement that the governor had visited colonias ``three times''
while inspecting flood damage and being briefed on water and sewage
problems. 

Some of the video's interviewees have been seen on television <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this
year</TIMEX2> before. 

Tamara Maschino, for example, a resident of the Clear Lake area of
Houston, criticizes Bush for his lack of attention to pollution
problems from chemical plants near her home. 

``We went to Governor Bush's office and spoke with John Howard, his
top environmental aide,'' Maschino says in the video. ``We met him
for <TIMEX2 val="PT1H" mod="MORE_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-23T22:33:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">over an hour</TIMEX2>. Nothing happened.'' 

Maschino also appeared in an attack advertisement broadcast in <TIMEX2 val="2000-SP" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
spring</TIMEX2> by the Sierra Club, in which similar accusations were
leveled. 

Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
said the aim of the video was to personalize the policy differences
between Bush and Vice President Al Gore. 

``It becomes about people, not politics, when you hear the
individuals,'' said Andrew, who traveled to Maine <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> to show the
video to reporters and voters at a community center in Portland and
on a college campus in Bangor. 

``We got 100 percent of the TV stations in Maine'' to attend the
events, he added. 

Terry Holt, communications director for Victory 2000, the campaign
arm of the Republican National Committee, said the video was the
latest in a series of Democratic efforts to get a prerecorded
message out through news organizations. 

``The Gore campaign has been very willing to produce television
spots for the purposes of a press release,'' he said, adding that it
was a fairly economical tool. 

``You can produce a spot <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-23T22:33:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">today</TIMEX2> for $10,000,'' Holt said. ``During
the Republican convention they unveiled four that I don't think
anyone ever saw.''

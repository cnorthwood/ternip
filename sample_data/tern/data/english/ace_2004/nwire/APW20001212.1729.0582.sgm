Dow Gains 93; Nasdaq Drops 40

NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks were mixed Tuesday as anxiety about high-tech
earnings and the election deadlock resurfaced on Wall Street. 

Technology issues rose smartly late last week after Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said he was inclined to lower interest rates
early next year. High-techs also advanced Monday, but investors are
too worried about poor earnings to extend the rally, analysts said. 

``There was some initial euphoria in the wake of Alan Greenspan's
clear message that he is poised to rescue the economy if it heads
toward recession, but there are still some concerns especially in
the chip sector that earnings will be disappointing,'' said Alan
Skrainka, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in
St. Louis. ``So we are seeing a shift to some of the defensive, more
stable stocks.'' 

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.91 to 10,818.71. 

Broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index was down
39.82 at 2,975.28, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was off 2.84
at 1,377.36. 

``Some people feel that 3,000 in the Nasdaq is an important level.
So, we are seeing some profit taking,'' Skrainka said. ``Clearly,
the short-term is dominated by worries about the political situation
and fourth-quarter earnings.'' 

Investors awaited a decision expected later in the day from the U.S.
Supreme Court on whether to allow Florida to recount its election
ballots to determine whether Vice President Al Gore or Texas Gov.
George W. Bush will be president. 

Wall Street considered the protracted political uncertainty as a
reason to sell tech stocks and retreat to blue chips. 

Chip makers were mixed after Advanced Micro Devices warned Monday
that weak demand for personal computers would lead to
lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. AMD inched up 25 cents
to trade at $17.56, but Intel, which issued a similar warning last
week, tumbled $2.38 to $35.06. 

Microsoft slid $2.19 to $55.88. Network equipment maker Cisco fell
50 cents to $54.31. 

The Dow saw big price changes and heavy trading in two of its most
well-known components. 

General Electric was significantly lower despite an upbeat outlook
delivered Monday by CEO Jack Welch to analysts. GE, which also
announced it will take a $4 billion charge for its acquisition of
Honeywell, fell $1.38 to $53.94. 

But General Motors rose $2.13 to $53.69 after the automaker
announced it will phase out its Oldsmobile division. 

So-called defensive buys traded higher. Banker J.P. Morgan soared
$3.19 to $159.94, and drug maker Johnson & Johnson rose $1.25 to
$96.88. 

Energy stocks were mixed after industry economists told the Senate
that natural gas and heating-oil prices will be high this winter.
They cited soaring demand, low inventories and forecast for colder
weather. Enron was down 81 cents at $75.69, but Exxon Mobile was up
63 cents at $86.38. 

The Russell 2000 index was down 3.84 at 483.39. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancers 4 to 3 on the New York Stock
Exchange where volume was 493.10 million shares, down from Monday's
522.67 million.

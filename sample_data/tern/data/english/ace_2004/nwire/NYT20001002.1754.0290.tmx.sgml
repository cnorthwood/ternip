Swarms of jellyfish consumed so many fish eggs and larvae in the
Gulf of Mexico <TIMEX2 val="2000-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this summer</TIMEX2> that some scientists are talking about
the potential for serious future threats to commercial and
recreational fisheries in the northern Gulf. 

The jellyfish, a native species and an invading one, appeared in
prime spawning areas just as breeding season for many of the Gulf's
most important species kicked into high gear. 

According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the number of
jellyfish in the Gulf has been rising for <TIMEX2 val="P13Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">at least 13 years</TIMEX2>.
Scientists say the jellyfish are exploiting three major
human-induced changes in the environment: thousands of oil rigs and
artificial reefs established to attract game fish have greatly
increased the breeding habitat for jellyfish, which need a hard
surface for spawning; nitrogen pollution from farm runoff and
industrial sources feeds plankton blooms, providing extra food for
jellyfish; and commercial fishermen take great numbers of menhaden,
a soft-finned, bony fish that competes with jellyfish for the
plankton. 

Dr. Monty Graham, a researcher at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in
Alabama, worries that with all these advantages jellyfish cannot
help but multiply at an astonishing rate. 

Making matters much worse, he said, is the advent of Phyllorhiza
punctata, or Australian spotted jellyfish. The giant species,
previously unreported in the Gulf, is a 25-pound bruiser of a
jellyfish native to the Pacific. 

<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-02T18:00:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">Some time ago</TIMEX2> the basketball-size jellyfish established themselves
in the Caribbean. <TIMEX2 val="2000-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This summer</TIMEX2>, after apparently riding ocean
currents north, they concentrated themselves in the passes between
the barrier islands that separate the Mississippi Sound from the
Gulf of Mexico. 

The Australian jellyfish have <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-02T18:00:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> mostly died off in the Gulf. But
fishery scientists worry that they may already have affected <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next
year</TIMEX2>'s fish populations. And scientists say the animals were
spawning prodigiously, broadcasting millions of their own eggs as
they ate the eggs and larvae of native species. 

Popular sport fish, including redfish, speckled trout, white trout
and Spanish mackerel, as well as commercially important species like
crabs and menhaden, spawn just outside the barrier islands. <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This
year</TIMEX2>, their eggs and larvae had to drift with tidal currents through
the jellyfish-choked passes to reach the estuaries that serve as
nurseries for the baby fish. 

``These things are incredibly efficient at turning the water over,
cleaning it of everything in it,'' Graham said. ``We're finding them
with 200 fish eggs in their guts.'' 

The newcomers had a frighteningly effective feeding pattern that
involved swimming to the surface, then diving down to the bottom,
scouring the water of virtually every living thing smaller than a BB
pellet. After flowing through the jellyfish gantlet, scientists
said, the water was almost devoid of living things. 

``You really have two problems in terms of commercially important
fish,'' said Harriet M. Perry, director of the fisheries section of
the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Mississippi. ``First the
jellies are ingesting the larvae and eggs of these commercially
important species, and then the fish larvae must compete with these
incredibly efficient jellies for the same food source.'' 

Perry said she worried that the Phyllorhiza might become permanent
residents. Graham said he feared that their offspring might appear
in larger numbers <TIMEX2 val="2001-SP" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next spring</TIMEX2>. 

He noted, though, that the newcomers represented a small threat
compared with the monstrous herds of native moon jellyfish still
swarming offshore below Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana in a huge
swath roughly 100 miles long and 30 miles wide. 

It is these jellyfish that worry Dr. Joanne Lyczkowski-Shultz, a
larval specialist with the National Marine Fisheries Service. 

Lyczkowski-Shultz said the long-term picture might be bleak if the
jellyfish populations continued to grow at their current pace. ``It
could be totally devastating,'' she said.

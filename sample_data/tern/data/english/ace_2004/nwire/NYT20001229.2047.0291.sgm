WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore's nationwide lead in the popular
vote has grown by about 200,000, to more than half a million, since
Dec. 18, when the Electoral College sealed his fate and made Gov.
George W. Bush the 43rd president of the United States. 

A state-by-state survey by The Associated Press of the final
certified results put Gore's popular-vote edge at 539,947, up
considerably from the lead of about 337,000 that was widely reported
in the first several weeks after the election. The totals were
50,996,116 for Gore and 50,456,169 for Bush. 

Much of the increase came in California, New York, and other,
smaller states that went for Gore, said Curtis B. Gans of the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a nonpartisan
research group that has followed presidential elections for a
quarter-century. 

Election officials in California and New York said Friday that the
bigger numbers for Gore were not hard to explain. Gore carried both
big states easily. Both states had big absentee-ballot totals that
could not be counted immediately and, because absentee votes
generally do not vary sharply from Election Night returns, it was
predictable that the absentees would widen the vice president's
lead. 

Gans said that in 1996, President Clinton's lead over Bob Dole grew
by some 200,000 votes from election night until all absentee ballots
were counted and all the votes certified, a fact all but forgotten
except by political trivia buffs. 

``But it didn't matter,'' Gans said, in a race that the incumbent
won by more than 8 million popular votes and by a 379-159 advantage
in the all-important Electoral College. 

In the 1960 election John F. Kennedy had the electoral vote edge and
a 114,673-vote margin in the popular vote over Richard Nixon. A
total of 68.8 million votes were cast for president. Eight years
later Nixon won the Electoral College and a popular-vote margin of
510,645 out of 73.2 million votes cast for president. 

The 2000 election, of course, will be remembered as the first in 112
years in which the leader in the popular vote lost the White House
because his opponent prevailed in the Electoral College. Bush got
271 electoral votes, one more than he needed for a majority and five
more than Gore, who lost one vote in the Electoral College when a
Washington, D.C., elector left her ballot blank to protest the
District of Columbia's lack of voting power in Congress. 

Gore won New York state, 4,107,697-2,403,374, or by some 1.7 million
votes. Lee Daghlian, the chief spokesman for the state's Board of
Elections, said Friday that about 360,000 absentee ballots were
requested, and that about 260,000 were returned in time to be
counted. In New York, absentee ballots must be postmarked no later
than the day before the election and received no later than a week
after the election. 

Daghlian said absentee balloting was about 20 percent higher this
year than in 1996. He speculated that the presence of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut on the Democratic ticket might have caused
more American Jews to mail ballots from Israel. 

It was clear on Election Night that Gore had carried California in a
landslide, so it was expected that the nearly 1.5 million absentee
ballots that arrived in time to be accepted would sharply augment
his victory _ and they did. 

The final certified totals in California were 5,861,203 for Gore and
4,567,429 for Bush. Alfie Charles, a spokesman for the California
secretary of state, Bill Jones, said the percentage of Californians
voting by absentee ballot has been increasing, and that about
one-quarter do now. (Californians, unlike people in some states, can
vote absentee without showing a compelling reason. Their ballots
must arrive by Election Day to be counted.)

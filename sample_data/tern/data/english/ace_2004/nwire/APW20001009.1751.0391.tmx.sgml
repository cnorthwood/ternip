Rabanne Fashion Has Silver Lining

PARIS (AP) _ Paco Rabanne's <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> show of ready-to-wear for <TIMEX2 val="2001-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">summer
2001</TIMEX2> was shiny, young and happy. He decided that fashion has a
silver lining _ and exterior, as well. 

The designer was expected to retire <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a couple of seasons ago</TIMEX2>, but he
only gave up haute couture, and threw his well-known talents for
chain-mail and sequins into boutique clothes. 

With a waterfall background, the models paraded by in gold or silver
disc dresses, super slithery silver metallic bikinis, wraps and
micro-mini dresses or hot pants. Well over sixty, Rabanne still has
an eye for the younger circuit. 

The smooth caramel imitation leather outfits with nailheads _
jackets, flared pants and more _ were remarkable. Also entertaining
was the bikini in tortoise-shell-patterned plastic discs. 

Bare midriffs and trousers flared and split halfway up the leg
looked zingy. Of course, there were hot pants, in glitzy metallics
and soft leather, and there were metal hip belts or breastplate
neckwear galore. 

Softwear here included geometrics on striped minis in little crepe
or organza dresses, some good trouser outfits with plastic or metal
adorning halter-neck toppers. 

For eye-popping specials, Rabanne came out with plenty of
fluorescent green and orange, quite fun for the disco in a rhodoid
disc-decorated minidress with matching bag. 

The long silky and tulle black ballerina outfits were a sober note,
though the sandals were interesting _ heels only, clinging to the
foot, with a ring on a toe. 

Dries van Noten also produced an amusing, appealing collection that
stood as a feminine moment. 

The flowered skirts in sun pleats, the interesting striped jackets
in Indian silk, teamed with shiny black and white patent high-heeled
pumps, looked partly retro, but eminently wearable. 

Low-keyed glamour here included flapper looks in low-belted outfits
with short pleated skirts, some super sailor-style trouser outfits
with fluid ivory or white pants and little jackets and striped
shirts. 

Prints for the georgette crepes and chiffons were often wonderful.
They looked like watercolors of arbors or fantasy flowers. Ruffles
peeping out here and there from skirts or on tops added more
feminine touches. 

Dresses in hibiscus-embroidered fabrics, large chiffon shawls with
floral embroideries, boxy silk jackets and the hipster pants all
made for a fine offering. 

Gaspard Yurkievitch, a young French designer, showing in the Petit
Palais, could make the grade in some stores with his offhand styles
that some find cool but that lacked sex appeal. 

A black bathing suit with a fawn suede jacket with nailhead snaps
was followed by skinny fawn trousers with plenty of bare midriff
showing under the black bra. 

Then things went into the puffy, baggy lines, the latest
look-back-to-<TIMEX2 val="198" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Eighties</TIMEX2> styles seen on some runways. In cotton satins
and other fabrics, Yurkievitch showed pants with baggy bottoms,
skirts with bubbly effects and some odd ruffles around armholes.
These often came in colors like magenta or brown. 

Even harem pants or a totally topless number with lacy black pants
and bikini bottoms failed to lure.

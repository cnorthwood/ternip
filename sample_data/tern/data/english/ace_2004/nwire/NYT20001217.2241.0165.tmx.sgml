Booking Your Ticket: 

_ Fly nonstop. The fewer connections you make, the lower the chance
that you will suffer a delay. 

_ Pick airports with care. If you have to connect, choose the
least-congested airport possible; some airports, like Chicago O'Hare
and La Guardia in New York, experience chronic delays. Take into
consideration the weather and <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the season</TIMEX2>; an airport in the South
might have fewer <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">winter</TIMEX2> snowstorms but more <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-SP" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">spring</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">summer</TIMEX2>
thunderstorms. 

_ Check <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">times between connecting flights</TIMEX2>. Airlines often book tight
connections and do not take responsibility if you miss yours. Assume
each leg of your flight will arrive late, and book connections that
allow <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">ample time</TIMEX2>. 

_ Check on-<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> records. The Transportation Department requires
major domestic airlines to make the on-<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> record for every flight
available to consumers. You can check online at
www.dot.gov/airconsumer. That site also reports each airline's
on-<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> record for <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the previous month</TIMEX2>. 

_ Travel on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">off-peak days</TIMEX2> and at <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="wasn't sure whether to give this hour, minute, or second granularity">off-peak times</TIMEX2>. <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-6" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> is usually
<TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-6" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the least-traveled day of the week</TIMEX2>; so are <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">major holidays</TIMEX2>. <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-1TMO" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday
mornings</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-5TAF" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday afternoons</TIMEX2> are <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">peak travel times for business
travelers</TIMEX2>. Flights leaving <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier in the day</TIMEX2> are less likely to be
delayed, because of the cascading effect that disruptions have on
airline schedules. 

_ Use smaller airports. Instead of Los Angeles International, for
example, consider flying into Burbank or John Wayne Airport in
Orange County, Calif., or use Westchester County Airport instead of
JFK in New York. 

_ Avoid electronic tickets. Though they are convenient and more
secure than an easily lost paper ticket, they are not transferable
between most airlines if you need to switch carriers because of
delays. 

_ Watch for labor disruptions. Check newspapers and Web sites like
www.thenewfoundlandgroup.com to identify airlines experiencing labor
strife, which often increases cancellations and delays. 

_ Leave a number. Make sure the airline you book with has a phone
number at which you can be notified of delays or cancellations. 

_ Use a travel agent. A good one can be a great ally in the event of
a problem _ and may save you <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> and money. 

<TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Day of Departure</TIMEX2>: 

_ Be informed. Check your flight's status before heading to the
airport. Automated telephone services or airline Web sites often
provide <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="generic present; no anchoring time">more up-to-date</TIMEX2> information than do ticket agents. The
Federal Aviation Administration's Web site, www.fly.faa.gov, has
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="generic present_ref; no anchoring time">real-time</TIMEX2> information on operations at the biggest airports. 

_ Pack defensively. Take along a change of clothes and a toothbrush
in your carry-on bag. If traveling with an infant, take <TIMEX2 val="PT24H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">24 hours</TIMEX2>'
worth of diapers and extra formula. When possible, avoid checking
luggage, in case you need to switch flights or carriers. Ship your
gifts ahead. 

_ Educate yourself. Find out what your airline promises to do for
passengers in the event of a delay. Print out a copy of the policy
from the airline's Web site, and carry it with you _ in case the
airline representatives need a reminder. 

If a Flight Is Delayed: 

_ Keep your cool. Becoming angry at airline personnel is
counterproductive. Sympathy for their plight will sometimes produce
results. 

_ Don't stand in line. To get on another flight, it is often more
effective to call the airline from the airport than to wait at the
ticket counter. Carry a cell phone; if delays are widespread, public
telephones may be in demand. 

_ Check the competition. If another airline has seats to your
destination, ask your airline to endorse your ticket to the other
line. 

_ Get what you paid for. If you paid full fare or are a high-mileage
frequent flier, let the airline know. Your odds of getting a seat on
the next flight out will increase, or the airline might pay for your
hotel, if you are delayed <TIMEX2 val="P1NI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">overnight</TIMEX2>. 

_ Consider driving. If the last leg of your flight is a 200-mile
hop, renting a car might be a better choice than waiting out a
delay. 

Getting Even: 

_ Write a letter. The airlines have pledged to respond to consumer
complaints within <TIMEX2 val="P60D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">60 days</TIMEX2>. They almost always offer a refund,
reimbursement of expenses, a discount on your next ticket _ or all
three. Be sure to save the relevant paperwork. 

_ Make it a federal case. Send a copy of your letter to Washington.
Complaints are charged against each airline in the Transportation
Department's <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">monthly</TIMEX2> Air Travel Consumer Report and serve as a basis
for rule making and enforcement action. Write to:

Russian To Restore Soviet Anthem

MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> overwhelmingly approved
the Soviet anthem as Russia's national hymn _ a move praised by some
as a gesture of reconciliation and denounced by others as a symbolic
approval of <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-08T11:30:15" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the nation's totalitarian past</TIMEX2>. 

The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, voted 381-51 to
approve the bill, which was strongly backed by President Vladimir
Putin. The move restored the old anthem's music by composer
Alexander Alexandrov but not the original text that included praise
for Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin. 

By the same strong majority, the Duma approved legislation formally
endorsing the country's current white-red-and-blue flag as Russia's
official flag. That legislation also brings back the <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Soviet-era</TIMEX2> red
banner as the military's flag and retains the Czarist double-headed
eagle as the state emblem. 

Putin has said the mixture of old Russian and Soviet symbols would
mend bitter rifts in society by paying tribute to the positive
heritage of <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">both periods</TIMEX2>. He referred to opinion polls showing that
most people prefer Alexandrov's music to a melody by <TIMEX2 val="18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">19th-century</TIMEX2>
composer Mikhail Glinka, which has been Russia's anthem since the
<TIMEX2 val="1991" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1991</TIMEX2> Soviet collapse. 

Liberal politicians and many leading cultural figures have strongly
opposed the reinstatement of the Soviet anthem, saying it symbolized
political repression. 

``We strongly protest against the Stalinist anthem, which is stained
by the blood of millions of victims,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, the
head of the liberal Yabloko faction. 

Yabloko and another liberal faction, the Union of Right Forces, said
they might appeal <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>'s vote in the Constitutional Court. The
Duma usually hears speeches by faction leaders before a vote, but
this time lawmakers skipped the debate _ a move the liberals
described as a procedural violation. 

``For the first time, the opposition was refused the right to speak
out,'' Yavlinsky said. ``The presidential administration and
Communists were afraid of our arguments against the Soviet anthem.'' 

<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-08T11:30:15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Former</TIMEX2> President Boris Yeltsin has joined other critics of the move
to restore the anthem. He said in an interview published <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> in
the <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">daily</TIMEX2> Komsomolskaya Pravda that the solemn music recalls
Communist Party congresses, not Soviet sports victories and
achievements in space, as Putin had said. 

``I'm categorically against the restoration of the Soviet anthem,''
Yeltsin said. 

Communists and other hard-liners had opposed the tricolor flag and
the eagle as a vestige of the Czars, forcing Yeltsin to approve them
by decree. But they agreed to abandon their criticism and back
formal approval for the symbols in response to the reintroduction of
the Soviet anthem. 

No conclusive version of new lyrics for the old music has been
approved yet. The Duma asked Putin to set up a panel to consider the
text and submit the final version for its approval. 

During <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>'s debate, Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said
officials had received an anonymous telephone call saying a bomb had
been planted in the building. Lawmakers ignored it and continued
their session as police officers with sniffer dogs searched the
premises.

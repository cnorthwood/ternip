COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) _ Joseph Conrad Parkhurst, who founded the
motorcycle magazine Cycle World in <TIMEX2 val="1962" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1962</TIMEX2>, has died. He was 74. 

Parkhurst had lung cancer and died <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="odd to refer the the previous week's Tuesday this way">Tuesday</TIMEX2> as a result of a blood
clot in his lung, his wife Claire Parkhurst told the Los Angeles
Times for Sunday editions. 

Cycle World brought objective journalism to motorcycle periodicals
by offering road tests and a more critical eye than other
fan-oriented magazines, said analyst Don Brown of DJB Associates LLC
of Irvine. 

In <TIMEX2 val="1962" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">its first year</TIMEX2>, Cycle World became _ and remains _ the largest
motorcycle magazine in the world, Brown and others said. It boasts a
<TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">monthly</TIMEX2> circulation of 315,000 and its closest rival is the German
magazine Das Motorrad. 

``Joe was a true pioneer in our business,'' said current Cycle World
publisher Larry Little. ``It was kind of a breaking of a good old
boy network of American motorcycles. Joe did not shun the Japanese
makers.'' 

Born in Jonesboro, Ark., on <TIMEX2 val="1926-10-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 20, 1926</TIMEX2>, Parkhurst moved with his
family to California. He served in <TIMEX2 val="1954" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1954</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1956" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">56</TIMEX2> as a clerk in an Army
Reserves office, then took a job as art director of Road & Track
magazine in Newport Beach. 

He later quit to spend <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1956" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">a year</TIMEX2> traveling in Europe and returned to
become art director of Carting World, a go-cart magazine, in <TIMEX2 val="1960" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1960</TIMEX2>.
While working, Parkhurst began dreaming of Cycle World. 

He thought that Road & Track's consumer approach could serve
motorcyclists, said Joe Rusz, a senior editor at Road & Track.
Parkhurst also loved riding motorcycles and once told a friend that
he ``could never find something worthwhile to read about them,''
Little said. 

Parkhurst later merged with another company that owned Road & Track
to become Bond/Parkhurst Publishing. He sold both magazines in <TIMEX2 val="197" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
early 1970s</TIMEX2>, said his wife of <TIMEX2 val="P22Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">22 years</TIMEX2>. Since <TIMEX2 val="1979" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1979</TIMEX2>, he has written
and published the Motorcycle Business Newsletter, a <TIMEX2 val="P2W" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">biweekly</TIMEX2> for
industry insiders. 

In addition to his wife, Parkhurst is survived by a brother, John
Parkhurst of Hemet. A memorial is planned for <TIMEX2 val="2001-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January</TIMEX2>.

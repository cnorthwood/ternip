LVMH MAKES A TWO-PART OFFER FOR DONNA KARAN

The fashion house of Donna Karan, which has long struggled to
achieve financial equilibrium, has finally found a potential buyer.
The giant luxury conglomerate LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton,
which has been on a sustained acquisition bid, has offered to
acquire Donna Karan International for $195 million in a cash deal
with the idea that it could expand the company's revenues and beef
up accessories and overseas sales. 

At $8.50 a share, the LVMH offer represents a premium of nearly 75
percent to the closing stock price on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>. Still, it is
significantly less than the $24 a share at which the company went
public in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>. The final price is also less than one-third of the
company's <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">annual</TIMEX2> revenue of $662 million, a significantly smaller
multiple than European luxury fashion houses like Fendi were
receiving <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>. 

The deal is still subject to board approval, but in a related move
that will surely help pave the way, LVMH purchased Gabrielle Studio,
the company held by the designer and her husband, Stephan Weiss,
that holds all of the Donna Karan trademarks, for $450 million. That
price would be reduced by as much as $50 million if LVMH enters into
an agreement to acquire DKI within <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="it's hard to pin down the anchor any further">one year</TIMEX2>. 

In a press release, LVMH said it aimed to combine Gabrielle and
Donna Karan International and that it expected that Karan and her
husband ``will exchange a significant portion of their DKI shares
for, and purchase additional stock in, the combined entity.'' 

Karan, who will stay on as chief designer and creative leader for
the design studio, called the decision to sell Gabrielle and
possibly her namesake design studio, of which she and Weiss still
own about 22 percent, as very emotional. 

She added, ``Yes, I am extraordinarily tied to it, but after lengthy
discussions I believe with all my heart that LVMH has the expertise,
resources, global scale and, most importantly, the vision, to make
this the luxury goods brand that was always our dream.'' 

Karan also expressed satisfaction that the Paris-based LVMH, which
like many European acquirers has been largely indifferent to
established American design houses, was interested in purchasing
hers. ``It is very flattering that they realize the value of the
trademarks,'' she said. 

Investors reacted enthusiastically, sending the stock up $3.63 to
$8.50. ``Ultimately, for them, acquisition is the best route to
go,'' said Harvey Robinson, an apparel analyst with the Chapman Co.,
a Baltimore-based investment bank and brokerage firm. ``We think
LVMH is getting a well-recognized brand with lots of cachet and we
believe they will be able to maximize on the acquisition.'' 

Since Donna Karan International went public in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>, its stock has
been a favorite whipping boy of Wall Street. Investors grumbled over
what they saw as excessive and uncontrolled spending as Karan, who
acted as chief designer as well as chief executive, spent heavily on
foreign travel for a large retinue and for expensive swaths of
fabric, only a tiny fraction of which were used for her collection.
As expenses ballooned, sales stumbled, leaving the Donna Karan
International initial public offering as one of the greatest
disasters of <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the year</TIMEX2>. 

In <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2>, the company hired John D. Idol to take over as chief
executive. Idol was able to increase revenue by signing copious
licensing agreements and cutting some expenses. The company
estimates earnings per share will be 66 cents for <TIMEX2 val="FY2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-31" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="we're making an exception for FYs, and anchoring the when the context specifically does so as well">the fiscal year
ending Dec. 31</TIMEX2>, compared with a loss of $3.78 a share in <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the year he
took the job</TIMEX2>. It is unclear what will happen to Idol if Donna Karan
International and Gabrielle merge. 

Despite the apparent financial improvement, investors have continued
to shun the company largely because of Karan's separate deal with
Gabrielle studio, which many felt was overly indulgent considering
the company's financial performance. That company, privately owned
by Karan and Weiss, collects a royalty of 1.75 percent of the first
$250 million of net sales <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year</TIMEX2>, rising to 3.5 percent of sales
that exceed $1.5 billion. <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last year</TIMEX2>, Donna Karan International paid
Karan and Weiss $25 million in <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year that the design house made
only $10 million in profit</TIMEX2>. 

If LVMH succeeds in acquiring Donna Karan International and combines
it with Gabrielle, the royalty arrangement would be moot. But
several industry insiders wondered whether LVMH is getting such a
great deal. Karan's name is already licensed to a wide array of
products, and because it is widely distributed through midprice
department stores, it lacks the exclusive appeal of names like Marc
Jacobs and Michael Kors. 

Myron Ullman, LVMH's managing director, counters that Karan has
built a ``well-respected global brand with opportunities in
accessories and to expand outside the U.S.'' Donna Karan
International gets 35 percent of its revenues from overseas. Idol
calls it the fastest-growing area of the company.

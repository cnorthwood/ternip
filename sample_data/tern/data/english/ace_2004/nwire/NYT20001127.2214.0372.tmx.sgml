SAN FRANCISCO _ ReplayTV Inc., a pioneering maker of digital video
recorders, said <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-27" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late Monday</TIMEX2> that its leader of <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">one year</TIMEX2> had
resigned, that it would lay off up to half of its work force of 260
and that it plans to reshape its business strategy. 

Along with TiVo Inc., a competing Silicon Valley startup company,
Replay has been trying to build a market for computer-based systems
that replace traditional videotape recorders and permit television
viewers to freeze programs and rewind, and to create custom
``channels.'' 

As part of its shift in strategy, Replay's founder, Anthony Wood,
will become the company's new chief executive, replacing Kim
LeMaster. The company also said it will try to refocus its business
on software licensing arrangements made with partners, including
cable service providers and makers of cable set-top boxes. 

``The new business model is focused more intently on the cable
industry,'' said Steve Shannon, Replay's vice president of
marketing. He said the company was in trials with Time Warner,
Comcast, Charter Communications and with AT&AMP;T. It also has
announced a development agreement with the Motorola Corp. to build
its software into a new generation of cable set-top boxes. 

Analysts said that despite offering free electronic service, in
contrast to TiVo's subscription service, ReplayTV has trailed in the
consumer market. TiVo's digital recorders are being manufactured by
Sony and Phillips, while ReplayTV systems are being shipped by
Panasonic. The company, which is based in Mountain View, Calif.,
said that it has so far sold approximately 20,000 units. 

``TiVo has had the `wow' factor,'' said Josh Bernoff, an industry
analyst at Forrester Research, a computer industry research and
consulting firm. ``The result is that Replay has been left with a
weakening market position and a device that works well but doesn't
look as great.'' 

However, that disadvantage will work to ReplayTV's advantage in
striking deals with the cable industry, he added. TiVo has had
difficulty building alliances with cable companies, who are not
generally interested in showcasing competing brands. 

On the horizon is Microsoft, which has also <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-27T22:23:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> entered the
market for personal video recorders with its own system, called
Ultimate TV.

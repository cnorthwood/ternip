Nicosia <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">9-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

A conference on peace in Cyprus began <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, attended by
dozens of opponents of the Afghan regime but in the absence of
representatives of the Taliban movement.


A spokesman for the Afghan government in exile, internationally
recognized and headed by Birhanaldin Rabbani (<TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1992</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>) said the
Islamic Taliban movement did not respond to the invitation sent to it
to attend the conference.


Abdurrahim told Agence France Press: "We participate in peaceful
efforts to solve the (Afghan) problem while the Taliban mistakenly
believe that the solution will be a military one."


However, he said it was possible that the Taliban would send a
representative to attend <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-15" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">future</TIMEX2> meetings on Afghanistan.


For his part, Sabghatallah Majdadi, who was acting president in <TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1992</TIMEX2>,
condemned the absence of Taliban representatives, saying "the
situation in Afghanistan is serious and the Afghan people are
suffering, meaning we need to act."


Participants in this conference, mainly Mujahideen and Afghan
intellectuals in exile, have met three times in Cyprus since <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2>.


The United Nations representative attended the conference <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>,
<TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, in an expression of the international community's solidarity
for initiatives aimed at bringing peace to Afghanistan.


Jean Pierre Castilla, the head of the United Nations special
delegation on Afghanistan, whose headquarters are in Tehran, said:
"We have to have confidence and stop the fighting between brothers
and reach a intermediate solution for all sides."


The Taliban movement ousted the Islamic regime led by Birhanaldin
Rabbani from Kabul in <TIMEX2 val="1996-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September 1996</TIMEX2> and imposed its fundamentalist
Muslim Sharia vision on the population.


Opposition forces led by Ahmed Shah Masoud are still fighting the
Taliban regime, which <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> controls over 80% of land in the country
but is so far only recognized by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates.

Dresden (Germany) <TIMEX2 val="2000-07-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">7-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

Police said clashes took place <TIMEX2 val="2000-07-15TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this Saturday afternoon</TIMEX2> in Dresden
(east) between approximately 300 neo-Nazi activists demonstrating in
the town center and approximately 200 far left demonstrators.


The police said that far left activists threw stones, eggs and apples
at the neo-Nazis, so security forces had to intervene by force to
separate the demonstrators to prevent further confrontations.

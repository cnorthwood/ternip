Abu Dhabi 11-15 (AFP) -

The Emirates news agency reported that Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir made a short visit today Wednesday to Abu Dhabi in the
course of which he discussed "developing cooperation" with the United
Arab Emirates.


The agency added that al-Bashir also informed Abu Dhabi's crown
prince Sheikh Khalifa Ben Zayid Al Nihyan of the "efforts to ensure
national concord through Libyan-Egyptian mediation," launched in
1999.


Since 1983, Sudan has lived through a civil war between the north,
with a majority population of Arab Muslims, and the south with its
majority population of animists and Christians.

The northern opposition has also taken up arms to bring down the
ruling regime in Khartoum.


The Sudanese president's previous visit to the Emirates was last
January when the president of the Emirate states, Sheikh Zayid Ben
Sultan Ben Al Nihyan, expressed his support for al-Bashir's decision
to exclude his main rival within the regime, Islamist Hassen
al-Turabi.

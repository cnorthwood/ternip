Awkward Problem for Lockerbie Court Judges
</HEADLINE>

Camp Zeist (Holland) <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">11-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, the judges in charge of looking into the Lockerbie
case in Camp Zeist (Holland) were faced with an awkward problem: how
to deal with a witness who is refusing to answer questions and who is
at <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the same time</TIMEX2> serving <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a life sentence</TIMEX2> and who is not subject to
Scottish law?


The problem arose after Palestinian Mahmood Abu Talib, whose
testimony the court has been hearing since <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, refused to
continue answering a question by defense lawyer Richard Keen about
the detailed reasons for his having lived in the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-15" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Soviet Union
for <TIMEX2 val="P18M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="197" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">a period of <TIMEX2 val="P18M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="197" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">18 months in <TIMEX2 val="197" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 70s</TIMEX2></TIMEX2></TIMEX2>.


The lawyer asked the judges to force Abu Talib to answer the question
aimed at demonstrating the witness's "professional terrorism"
precedents.


<TIMEX2 val="P46Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">46-year-old</TIMEX2> Abu Talib was sentenced to life imprisonment in <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2> in
Sweden for terrorist acts in Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm
between <TIMEX2 val="1985" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1985</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1986" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1986</TIMEX2>. The defense council in the Lockerbie court is
attempting to show his involvement in the Lockerbie attack.


Based on Scottish law, followed in this court, if Abu Talib insists
on not responding to the question, this is considered to be "contempt
of court" and means he may be punished in accordance with Scottish
law covering such incidents.


The problem is that the judges may not punish Abu Talib unless Sweden
hands him over to Scotland after the court case ends to apply the
punishment for "contempt of court."


So far, the judges have not asked Abu Talib to answer the defense's
question in what appears to be a move to avoid a tricky situation if
the witness refuses to answer.


The court president, Ronald Sutherland, who adjourned the session for
<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a short while</TIMEX2> in an attempt to find a solution to this dilemma, said
"this raises an important question of principle."


The two Libyans, Alameen Khalifa Fahima and Abdulbasit al-Maqrahi,
are suspected of sending a bomb from Malta which was used to explode
the Pan Am plane over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on <TIMEX2 val="1988-12-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December
21, 1988</TIMEX2> killing 270 people.

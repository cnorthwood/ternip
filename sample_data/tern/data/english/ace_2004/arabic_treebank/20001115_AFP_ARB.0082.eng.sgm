UNRWA Makes Urgent Appeal for 40 Million Dollars in Aid for
Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

Amman 11-15 (AFP) -

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees
(UNRWA) made an urgent appeal today Wednesday to donor countries for
40 million dollars as humanitarian aid for Palestinian refugees
negatively affected by Israeli violence in the Palestinian
Territories.


A statement by the United Nations agency said it was appealing to
donor countries to provide assistance amounting to "39.3 million
dollars in the coming three months in order to increasing
humanitarian needs of Palestinian refugees negatively affected" by
violence.


The head of the agency's coordination program in Amman, Maher Nasser,
said in a press conference that the aid was aimed at "providing food
and medical aid to Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza
suffering as a result of the Israeli blockade of the Palestinian
Territories, as well as at repairing houses damaged by Israeli
bombing and buying additional ambulances" to transport the rising
number of wounded.


He said that since the bloody events in the Palestinian Territories
started last September 28, UNRWA had opened its medical centers to
all those wounded in the Palestinian Intifada and not just refugees.


The UNRWA statement said that aid would also provide Palestinian
refugees with work opportunities in the Bank and Gaza, where the
rising rate of unemployment is "currently at 40% compared to 11%"
before last September 28 and Israel does not allow Palestinian
workers to enter Israel.


Nasser said that UNRWA workers in the Palestinian Territories were
facing many difficulties and obstacles since the start of the events
and that trucks carrying humanitarian aid were being stopped by
Israeli forces who also fired at them at times.


Last October 24, the organization appealed for urgent help worth 4.8
million dollars. The organization's statement today said that
although UNRWA had received only 1.9 million dollars as a result of
that appeal, this sum allowed it to keep its medical centers open in
the Palestinian Territories.


UNRWA was set up fifty years ago and offers assistance in the field
of education, health and social services to about 1.6 million
Palestinian refugees in Jordan, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Lebanon
and Syria.

Manila 8-15 (AFP) -

The Philippine government's chief negotiator for hostage release,
Roberto Avintagado, has made huge efforts to secure the safe release
of hostages kidnapped by Islamic group Abu Sayyaf. However, from next
month, he will concentrate his efforts on trying to lead his country
to win its first Olympic gold medal at the Sydney Olympics, which run
from June 15 to October 1.


Avintagado, who is president of the Philippines Olympic Committee,
began negotiations to secure the release of hostages held by Abu
Sayyaf on the island of Jolo three months ago, but the rest of the
time he supervises preparation of the Philippines' squad to the
Olympic Games.


Avintagado said: "I am making extra efforts to try and end the
hostage situation before the Games begin," adding that "the
Philippines has never won a gold medal in the history of the Olympic
Games and my dream is to win one in Sydney."


Avintagado, who is also president of the Taekwondo Association, will
also head the 20-strong Philippine team in Sydney.


He hopes that one of the athletes will win a first gold medal for his
country. The only two medals the Philippines have won to date were
silver medals for boxing.

On the same subject, he said: "It would be a beautiful dream if we
won a gold medal for Taekwondo."


Avintagado, who met Abu Sufyan face-to-face without any bodyguards to
negotiate the matter of the hostages, described the situation as
"very dangerous indeed."


Avintagado, who was crowned the Philippines rally champion four times
in the 80s, said on the subject: "While car racing taught me to take
risks, Taekwondo has given me composure, which has helped me succeed
in my work as a hostage negotiator."


In 1998, Avintagado was given an award by His Holiness Pope John Paul
II in recognition of his efforts to negotiate the release of the
Vatican's envoy, Italian Luciano Benedetti, in Mindano.

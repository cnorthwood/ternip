Zagreb 9-15 (AFP) -

A judicial source said today, Friday, that five Croatians were
arrested last Tuesday during an operation targeting a number of war
criminals suspected of involvement in the killing of around 50
Serbian civilians in 1991.


Croatian radio said that Tihomir Ursiovich, in charge of defending
the town of Gospic (150 km south of Zagreb) when the fighting between
Croatians and Serbs broke out, Eveka Rosiatch, Yusu Miliatch, Martan
Markovich and Ivan Yovanovic were transferred from Gospic to Rijeka.


The radio added that around 100 former fighters demonstrated in
Gospic against the arrest of those they regard as equivalent to war
heroes.

Egyptian Caricaturists' Exhibition in Support of Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cairo 10-15 (AFP) -

The Egyptian Caricaturists' Association held a shared exhibition by
caricaturists in Egypt yesterday evening Saturday at the headquarters
of the Arab League in Cairo with paintings condemning Israeli
aggression against the Palestinian people.


The Arab League's secretary-general, Ismet Abdulmajid, opened the
exhibition with a speech in which he stated his "pride in what the
brushes of artists taking part in the exhibition have produced in
terms of solidarity with the Palestinian people and condemnation of
Israeli aggression against the unarmed Palestinian people."


The exhibition included over seventy paintings, one of the most
striking of which was by artist Mustapha Hussein's depiction of the
Nazi dimension of Israeli practices and showing Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak in military uniform with a Nazi insignia above
his head and a lake of blood around him as he stands atop the Dome of
the Rock.


Artist Naji Kamil's painting portrayed the transformation of Judaism
from a heavenly religion to a criminal religion because of its war,
through his painting of a tank with seven guns turning the
seven-pronged Jewish menorah into an instrument of aggression.


The youngest participant in the exhibition, Nashwa Farouq, drew a
Palestinian child with stones around him trying to stop a tank with
his hands.


Elsewhere, Egyptian actor Ahmed Badir told Agence France Presse today
Sunday that a delegation of Egyptian painters yesterday handed over
to the presidential offices a manifesto issued by the Egyptian
artists after a sit-in on Friday night calling for rejection of the
Sharm el-Sheikh summit.


Badir, who was one of the delegates, said "the sit-in protestors'
manifesto was handed over to the Egyptian republic's presidential
offices yesterday afternoon Saturday."

Badir is a member of the administrative board of the Egyptian Actors'
Union.


He said the manifesto emphasizes "rejection of holding a summit
conference attended by (Israeli Prime minister Ehud) Barak (tomorrow
Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh), stopping and freezing the normalization
process, shutting down Arab offices in Israel, expelling the Israeli
ambassador and shutting down the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, calling on
Arab leaders to resurrect the joint defense agreement, bringing
forward the Arab Summit (scheduled this 21-22) and passing firm
resolutions to end the shedding of torrents of Palestinian blood."


Hundreds of Egyptian artists demonstrated and held a sit-in in front
of their union headquarters in Cairo on Friday evening where they
burned the Israeli and American flags.

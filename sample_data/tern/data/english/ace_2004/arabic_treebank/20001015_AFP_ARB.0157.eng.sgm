Druze in Lebanon Call On Israeli Druze to Join Intifada
</HEADLINE>

Beirut 10-15 (AFP) -

The political leader of the Lebanese Druze, Walid Jumblatt, and
faction representatives today Sunday called on members of their
faction in Israel to disobey and join the Palestinian Intifada.


Seven Lebanese Druze representatives out of eight who met under the
leadership of representative Walid Jumblatt called on "youths in our
Islamic Arab faction to actively join the heroic Palestinian Intifada
against Israeli occupation and its agents, and to expose its means
and methods."


Only representative Talal Arslan did not attend the meeting.


The statement added "you must reject conscription regardless of the
terrorist methods practiced by the Zionist enemy against you; you
must disobey orders and leave the occupation army immediately even if
you face arrest and torture until martyrdom as has happened to many
of your predecessors."


Representative Walid Jumblatt is Syria's longtime ally, although he
called last summer for a reassessment of relations between Lebanon
and Syria.


Around 75 thousand Druze hold Israeli citizenship and are required to
do national service in the Jewish State's army, as was the case of
one of the three soldiers captured by Lebanese Hizbollah on the 7th
of this month.

An Angolan air force source told Agence France Presse that at least
41 people died in an Antonov 24 plane crash accident soon after
take-off from Luanda airport in Angola <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>.

local time</TIMEX2>.


Portuguese radio station TSF reported the air traffic control tower
at Luanda Airport saying that there were no survivors of the plane
crash accident.


A correspondent for the Portuguese news agency Lusa said the bodies
of the victims, forty and one person on the ground, were totally
incinerated.


The correspondent added that the crew lost control of the plane on
take-off a few meters after it left Luanda Airport's runway and that
it crashed in a suburb of the Angolan capital, 800 meters from a
residential complex.


An air force source said there was a refugee camp near the site of
the accident.


Travel agency staff present in the airport told Agence France Presse
that they had seen smoke coming out of one of the engines.


The plane, also carrying cargo, was headed for the coastal town of
Namibi (1200 southwest of Luanda).


Angola's civil aviation authority simply confirmed the accident
without providing any further details.


The Angolan Aviators Association asked the authorities to suspend
Antonov flights throughout the country.


It should be recalled that an Antonov 26 plane with 48 passengers on
board crashed on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October 31</TIMEX2> in the province of Luanda-Soul (1200 km
to the east of Luanda).


The National Union for Total Independence in Angola (UNITA, the armed
rebel movement) declared it had shot down the plane but the regular
army denied this.

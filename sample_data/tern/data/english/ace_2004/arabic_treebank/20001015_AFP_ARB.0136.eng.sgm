Baghdad 10-15 (AFP) -

The passengers of the hijacked Saudi plane headed for Saddam
International Airport this afternoon Sunday to board their plane for
the return trip to Saudi Arabia then onto London.


An Agence France Presse correspondent said the Transport and
Communications Minister Ahmed Murtadha Ahmed was bidding the
passengers farewell as they left the al-Rashid Hotel, where foreign
visitors stay in Baghdad, in three coaches belonging to Iraqi Airways
while Prince Bender Ben Abdulrahman, a member of the royal family,
left in a luxury car accompanied by Iraqi officials.


The Iraqi news agency said there were 104 passengers, including 14
crew members.


The Iraqi minister shook hands with the travelers and wished them a
safe and sound journey home.


The plane hijacking operation ended peacefully after midnight
yesterday Saturday, a few hours following the hijacking, which took
place in Egyptian airspace after the plane took off from Jeddah on
its flight to London.


The Iraqi authorities arrested the two kidnappers, whom Baghdad
confirmed were Saudi Arabians.

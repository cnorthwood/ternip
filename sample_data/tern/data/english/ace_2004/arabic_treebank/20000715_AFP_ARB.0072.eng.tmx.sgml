Jerusalem <TIMEX2 val="2000-07-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">7-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

A high level Israeli army official has said <TIMEX2 val="2000-07-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-07-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> that
Israel believes Iran is set to begin acquiring nuclear capability for
military purposes from <TIMEX2 val="2005" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2005</TIMEX2> and will be in a position to equip
missiles with nuclear warheads, capable of reaching Israel, within
<TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="or is this STARTING 2005? -- when they will accumulate the nuclear capability">ten years</TIMEX2>.


The official, who wished to remain anonymous, told journalists: "Iran
will start accumulating nuclear capability for military purposes from
<TIMEX2 val="2005" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2005</TIMEX2> and will be in a position, within <TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="or STARTING 2005?">the space of <TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">10 years</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, to
produce nuclear warheads that can be fitted to missiles capable of
striking Israel."


The official made these statements after Tehran announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-07-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>
<TIMEX2 val="2000-07-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> that it had "successfully" completed a new test on the
Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a range of 1300 kilometers.


The official further said: "Iran is not capable of developing a
nuclear program without Moscow's help."


He said that according to information obtained by Israel, tests on
the Shahab 3 ground-ground missile were in fact "successful and
reached their maximum range of 1300 kilometers which allows them to
reach strategic centers in Israel."


The official said that the design of the Shahab missile is based on a
North Korean missile called Nodong, itself developed from the Soviet
Scud missile.


The official also stressed that Iran regards the "destruction of
Israel as legitimate," saying that "Tehran is embroiled in strategic
terrorist activities targeting Israel, especially alongside
Palestinian and Lebanese organizations."


The official further considered that "the Shahab missile will not
come into operation for <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">two years</TIMEX2> and that an improved range of 2000
kilometers would only be achieved after <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">this period</TIMEX2>."


Israel's Deputy Defense Minister, Ephraim Sneh, said <TIMEX2 val="2000-07-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-07-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>
that Israel would "know how to find a suitable response" to the
Iranian Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a 1300 kilometer range.


Sneh said on army radio that "Israel will prepare itself to find a
suitable response to this threat," without giving any further
details.


The Iranian army announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-07-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-07-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> that it had "successfully"
completed a new test on Shahab 3 ground-ground missiles.


An official at the Iranian Ministry of Defense told Tehran Radio that
the "Shahab 3 defense missile was tested a second time to ensure it
conforms to international standards."


In <TIMEX2 val="1998-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July 1998</TIMEX2>, the first test on this missile was announced. It is
capable of reaching the majority of countries in the region,
including Israel.

Amman 10-15 (AFP) -

A Jordanian military source confirmed this evening Sunday that rounds
of ammunition were fired by "unknowns" from Jordanian territory in
the direction of an Israeli patrol in the West Bank, resulting in two
of its members being injured.


Petra, Jordan's official news agency, reported a military spokesman
as saying "unknown persons this evening fired rounds of ammunition at
an Israeli patrol 7 kilometers south of the Prince Mohamed Bridge and
injured two of its members."


The prince Mohamed Bridge is located on the River Jordan near the
town of Nablus on the West Bank and connects west Jordan with the
West Bank.


The Jordanian military spokesman added that "an investigation is
currently underway to identify the perpetrators."


An Israeli military source had previously announced that two Israeli
soldiers received minor injuries today in a shooting originating from
Jordan in the Jordan Valley to the north of Jericho on the West Bank.


The source said the two soldiers were close to the settlement of
Jilgal about ten kilometers north of Jericho near the Jordanian
border.

The two soldiers were carrying out a routine patrol when they were
shot at.

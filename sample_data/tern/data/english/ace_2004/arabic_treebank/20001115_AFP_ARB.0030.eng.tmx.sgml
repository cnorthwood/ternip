Gaza <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">11-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

A Palestinian medical source reported <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> that more than
fifteen Palestinians were injured <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this morning</TIMEX2> in the town of Rafah
in the southern Gaza Strip in clashes with the Israeli army.


Medical sources said "at least 15 Palestinians were injured by live
bullets fired by Israeli soldiers, including six children all shot in
the head."


Eyewitnesses said the clashes broke out when the Israeli army began
bulldozing Palestinian land near the border with Egypt and opened
fire randomly on Palestinian citizens when they threw stones at the
soldiers in protest. An Israeli tank also fired a rocket.


Elsewhere, Israeli bulldozers dug up dozens of hectares of
Palestinian farmland near the village of Alkarara (near the Kosovim
checkpoint) <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-14TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last night</TIMEX2> for <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the second day in a row</TIMEX2>, destroying two
houses and a well, where the army erected a new military camp
instead.


The town's authorities said <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-14TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last night</TIMEX2> the Israeli army dug up
several hectares planted with orange trees in southern Gaza
(Nitsarim).


The bulldozing of land began <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-13TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the night before <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-14TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last</TIMEX2></TIMEX2> when an Israeli
soldier was killed in a shooting incident in the area.

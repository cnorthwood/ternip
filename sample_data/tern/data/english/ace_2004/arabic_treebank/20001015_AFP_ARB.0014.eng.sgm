Jerusalem 10-15 (AFP) -

An Israeli army spokesman told Agence France Presse today, Sunday,
that the army was "investigating" the claim by Hizbollah's
secretary-general, Sheikh Hassen Nasrallah, that an Israeli officer
with the rank of colonel had been captured.


The spokesman said: "We are conducting an investigation but at
present do not have any element allowing confirmation" of the matter.


Hizbollah's secretary-general announced today, Sunday, that Islamic
Resistance, this movement's armed wing, had succeeded in capturing an
Israeli officer with the rank of colonel.


Nasrallah said in a speech at the opening of the Arab conference in
Beirut in support of the intifada that Islamic Resistance "has
succeeded in capturing an Israeli officer with the rank of colonel in
the course of a difficult operation, details of which we will give at
a later date."


Nasrallah did not reveal how, when and where the operation took
place.


However, pro-Hizbollah al-Manar television network announced in an
urgent news bulletin that the fundamentalist party "succeeded this
morning, Sunday, in capturing an Israeli officer with the rank of
colonel."


Hizbollah captured three Israeli soldiers, two of them with the rank
of sergeant and the third with the rank of staff sergeant, this 7th
of October.

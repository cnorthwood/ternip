Baghdad 10-15 (AFP) -

The Iraqi news agency reported that a Turkish plane carrying a trade
and medical delegation landed at Saddam International Airport in
Baghdad this afternoon, Sunday


The agency said the delegation will visit Iraq for a few days in the
course of which it will hold talks with the Iraqi leadership on
"expanding areas of trade cooperation and exchange" between the two
countries.


It added that the Turkish medical delegation would look into the
"negative effects of the sanctions on Iraqi hospitals."


A Turkish plane carrying a trade, medical and press delegation landed
at Saddam International Airport yesterday Saturday.


To date, Turkey has sent four planes to Iraq since Saddam
International Airport re-opened last August 17.


Last Wednesday, the United States asserted that Syria and Egypt had
breached United Nations resolutions by sending planes to Baghdad
without obtaining the authorization of the international
organization's Sanctions Committee, pointing out that Turkey obtained
authorization from the international organization's Sanctions
Committee to send its planes.

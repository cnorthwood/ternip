Jerusalem <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">11-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

Official Israeli radio reported that the lesser security cabinet
which met <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this evening</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> has made a series of practical
decisions pointing to its desire to avoid confrontations with the
Palestinians.


The radio reported "senior political officials" as saying at the
close of the security cabinet's meeting, chaired by Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, that the army would continue with the procedure it has
followed over <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-15" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the past days</TIMEX2> and that there would be no escalation.


Military officials who also attended the meeting that Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat "wants to drag Israel into an escalation
which would lead to international intervention."


The head of the prime minister's office, Jalaad Shir, had previously
said on official television that "a compromise must be found between
a studied response not leading to escalation and the need to pave the
way for political openness, on the condition that the Palestinians
resolutely stop the violence and incitement to violence."


Shir added "only then will it be possible to think about resuming the
political process and on what basis."


The security cabinet was convened to a session with the aim of
examining new measures to deal with the escalation in attacks against
Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Intifada began, to elimination of Hussein Abiyat the military leader

combat helicopter targeted his car.

Moscow <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">8-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

Interfax news agency reported Russian Naval Commander Admiral
Vladimir Kuroyedov as saying <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> that the one hundred and
sixteen sailors on board the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, which
settled at a depth of 100 meters in the sea, were "still alive but
the situation is grave and the authorities fear the worst for the
crews' lives."


Kuroyedov added that the "possibility of completing the rescue
operation successfully is very much dependent on the situation inside
the submarine" and said that the crew remaining alive depended on a
series of factors.


And he said: "The number of submerged compartments, the increase in
air pressure and temperature, and the state of the air supply are all
factors affecting <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the length of time they can remain alive</TIMEX2>."


He carried on to say: "The rescue teams are aware of all this and
will do their best to save the submarine crew in spite of the poor
weather conditions."


He said he had no information about any dead or injured members of
the submarine crew.


The Russian authorities had previously announced that strong winds in
the Barents Sea had prevented rescue work from continuing.


Admiral Kuroyedov said that "the sea is very rough and rescue teams
cannot set anchor."


He also said that the rescue teams were inspecting the submarine
externally because "the reasons for it sinking are not yet known."
Navy sources suggested it resulted from a collision with another
ship.


For his part, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said that the Navy
intends to evacuate the submarine crew but that a storm was
preventing this at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-08-15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">present</TIMEX2>.


He said that the "situation is difficult" but refused the help
offered by Washington, saying that "we have all the necessary
technical means which are no less than those of the Americans."


Sources at the Admiralty said telephone contact with the crew had
stopped on <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> but that "audio contact" and communication were
possible using Morse code.


Interfax said the northern fleet spokesman, Vladimir Navrotski, said
"that it is not possible at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-08-15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">present</TIMEX2> to talk about positive results"
of the rescue operations.


Television broadcasts <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> said the Fleet Admiral had not given any
detailed information about the progress of rescue operations.

Inerfax limited itself to saying that "two rescue devices did not
complete their tasks because of poor weather conditions."


The devices were meant to attach to the submarine to supply it with
oxygen and fuel and to prepare for the evacuation of the crew.


The Russian Navy said the submarine was equipped with 24 missiles but
that none of them carried nuclear warheads.


The Kursk, one of the Russian navy's most modern models, sank about
150 km from the Siveromorsk base 69.4 degrees north and 37.5 degrees
south in international waters between Russia and Norway.


The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (Stralevern) said that
it had not detected any radiation as of <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-14TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday evening</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>.


This incident, which involved a submarine that entered service in
<TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1995</TIMEX2>, is the deadliest of its kind since the Soviet submarine
Komsomolits sank off the coast of Norway in <TIMEX2 val="1989" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1989</TIMEX2>, resulting in the
death of 42 people.

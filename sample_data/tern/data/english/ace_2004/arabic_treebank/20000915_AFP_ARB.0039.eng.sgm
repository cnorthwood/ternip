Madrid 9-15 (AFP) -

Spain's Interior Minister Jamie Mayor Oriega announced this evening,
Friday, the arrest of separatist organization Eta's presumed leader
Ignacio Gracia Arregui, nicknamed "Inaki de Renteria" in Bidar
(southeast France).


French police in Bayonne (France) said they arrested Arregui as well
as his French wife in his house in Bidar.


Arregui, who is considered to be the Eta organization's top man, was
arrested at 17h45 Greenwich time in the area where French police
arrested the organization's leadership and its leader at the time,
Francesco Mojica Garmindia in March 1992.


The Spanish judiciary suspects Arregui, who was born in Renteria
(Spanish Basque country) in 1955, of ordering a failed attack on King
Juan Carlos in 1995.

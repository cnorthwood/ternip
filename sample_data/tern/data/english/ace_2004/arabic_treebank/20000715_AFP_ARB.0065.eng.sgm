Dresden (Germany) 7-15 (AFP) -

Police said clashes took place this Saturday afternoon in Dresden
(east) between approximately 300 neo-Nazi activists demonstrating in
the town center and approximately 200 far left demonstrators.


The police said that far left activists threw stones, eggs and apples
at the neo-Nazis, so security forces had to intervene by force to
separate the demonstrators to prevent further confrontations.

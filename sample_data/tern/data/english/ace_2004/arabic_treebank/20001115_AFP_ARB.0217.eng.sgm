Japan and Russia to Hold Summit on Coral Islands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bandar Seri Begawan 11-15 (AFP) -

A Japanese official announced today Wednesday that Japan and Russia
are to hold a summit before the end of the current year in an attempt
to find a solution to their dispute about the Coral Islands, which
has hindered the signing of a peace treaty between the two countries
since the end of World War II.


The decision to hold the summit was made during the meeting between
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori on the periphery of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in Brunei.


The Japanese official said that those responsible had "agreed to meet
at Irkotsik (east Russia) before the end of the year.


In 1997, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister
Riotaro Hashimoto agreed to sign the peace treaty before the end of
2000, but negotiations have not progressed much since then.


Russia and Japan have been unable to sign a peace agreement since
1945 because of their dispute concerning four of the Coral islands
located between Russia and Japan and which were invaded by Russian
forces in the last few days of World War II.


Putin visited Japan last September but the visit did not produce any
result on the issue of the islands.

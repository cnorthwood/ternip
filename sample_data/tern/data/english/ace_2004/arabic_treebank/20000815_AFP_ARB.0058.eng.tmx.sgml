Moscow <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">8-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

It is possible to save the crew on the Russian submarine Kursk, which
settled at the bottom of the Barents Sea <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day before <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>
<TIMEX2 val="2000-08-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, by "individual ascent" or by using a rescue basket or the
rescue capsules present in the submarine.


A military intelligence expert, Vladimir Orban, said the crew does
not have permission to abandon the submarine unless authorized to do
so by the fleet's command.


Individual ascent:

Komsomoliska Pravda reported Boris Pavlov, head of the Biological
Crisis Institute, as saying: "The submarine carries means for
individual rescue in the form of diving suits and oxygen/helium
tanks.

The sailor leaves via the airlock (SAS) or torpedo tube and ascends
to the surface like any other diver.

However, he would suffer from pressure changes because the ascent
takes <TIMEX2 val="PT5M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">five</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="PT6M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">six minutes</TIMEX2> and no decompression stops will have been
made."


He added that "a depth of one hundred meters is no problem for a
submarine the size of Kursk."


On the other hand, the newspaper Sigodina reported that the "crew on
board submarine K-429 belonging to the Pacific Ocean Fleet were
unable to ascend from a depth of sixty meters in <TIMEX2 val="1983" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1983</TIMEX2>."


Ascending in a "basket" filled with oxygen suspended from a rescue
boat attached to the submarine.

Each basket can carry five to six people each time.


Ascending using the two rescue capsules found in the central part of
the submarine: the entire crew can ascend in the two capsules if
their lives are in danger.

In Ramallah, around 500 people took to the town's streets chanting
slogans denouncing the summit and calling on Palestinian Authority
leader Yasser Arafat not to take part in it.


Witnesses said confrontations took place between the demonstrators
and Israeli soldiers at the entrance to the town and resulted in two
Palestinians being hit with live ammunition while a third Palestinian
was injured with a rubber-coated bullet.


The injured included Ismael Kudhir, a sound technician with Reuters
international news agency.


<TIMEX2 val="P23Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">23-year-old</TIMEX2> Khudhir was injured in the thigh while covering the
confrontations and was taken to Ramallah hospital for treatment.


In Bethlehem, there were several demonstrations against the summit,
including marches that started immediately upon leaving church after
the sermon.


A number of demonstrators threw stones and empty bottles at Israeli
soldiers positioned near a Jewish holy site at the town's entrance.


Witnesses said the soldiers responded by firing tear gas and rubber
bullets, which led to ten demonstrators being injured.


Clashes occurred to the west of Bethlehem where demonstrators damaged
a generator belonging to the nearby Bitar Eilat settlement.


Islamic Jihad movement had previously declared that the Sharm
el-Sheikh summit "absolves (Israeli Prime Minister Ehud) Barak and
aborts Arab and Muslim attempts to come together around the
Palestinian people."


It added "attending Sharm el-Sheikh because America wants it when the
blood of martyrs has not yet dried and before the Arab summit is held
absolves Barak of the martyrs' blood and is an attempt to stop Arabs
and Muslims coming together around the Palestinian people. It is a
move to forestall the Arab summit and release it from any obligation
to our people and their cause."

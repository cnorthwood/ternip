Harare 7-15 (AFP)-

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe announced to journalists this
evening Saturday that he had formed a new government, following
legislative elections last June, with no opposition members included.


The government, which was formed following legislative elections held
last month and which the ruling party won by a slim majority,
includes 19 ministers all of whom are members of the Zimbabwe African
National Union - Patriotic Front.


The new government consists of 17 ministers and 2 undersecretaries.


The list, announced by President Mugabe at a press conference,
reveals that the new government includes 10 new ministers selected
from public figures and given ministerial posts for the first time,
including a young minister named Simba Makoni appointed as head of
the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development under circumstances
where the country is witnessing an unprecedented economic crisis.


Elsewhere, Stan Modinge retains his appointment as Foreign Minister
and Moven Mahashi as Defense.


In the recent legislative elections, the run-up to which was marked
by violence, the ruling party won 62 out of the 150 parliamentary
seats, in addition to the thirty seats whose incumbents are appointed
by the country's president.

The opposition won 58 seats, 57 of which were taken by the Movement
for Democratic Change, the largest opposition party.

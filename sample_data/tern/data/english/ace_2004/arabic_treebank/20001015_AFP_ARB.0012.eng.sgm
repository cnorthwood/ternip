Israel Warns Against Unilateral Declaration of a Palestinian State
</HEADLINE>

Jerusalem 10-15 (AFP) -

Israeli warned today, Sunday, against a unilateral declaration of a
Palestinian state, asserting that in such a case it would not be
obligated by the likely ceasefire during the Sharm el-Sheikh summit.


Danny Yatoum, chief advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
told army radio: "In the event of Yasser Arafat (Palestinian
president) unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state in the coming
days, Israel will not feel it is obligated by any agreements or
measures which might be arrived at on Monday during the Sharm
el-Sheikh summit."


Yatoum added: "If there is a unilateral declaration, Israel will take
action as it sees fit to ensure its security and to defend its vital
interests."


In the past, Barak has hinted that Israel might annex sectors of the
West Bank, where the majority of Israeli settlements are, in the
event of Arafat declaring independence unilaterally.


Arafat postponed declaration of a Palestinian state, which was
scheduled for September 13, without fixing a new date for that.

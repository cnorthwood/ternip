London <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">8-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

British Airways announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> that all Concorde flights are
to be grounded immediately following recommendations by the air
navigation authorities.


British Airways chief executive Rod Eddington said the decision was
made because both the British and French Civil Aviation Authorities
are preparing to issue a recommendation on <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> suspending
flight certificates for all Concorde planes.


Eddington said the British Air Accident Investigation Branch
"notified us <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this morning</TIMEX2> that, in light of the latest information,
it would along with its French counterpart recommend that the
aircraft's flight certificate be suspended <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2> (<TIMEX2 val="2000-08-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>)."


The British Airways official did not disclose the nature of the
information leading to this recommendation.


A company spokesman told Agence France Presse that it was "too early
to say" how long Concorde would be grounded.


British Airways made the decision to resume use of the Concorde
planes it owns after the Air France Concorde crash near Paris <TIMEX2 val="1999-07-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last
July 25</TIMEX2> that killed 113 people.


Since <TIMEX2 val="1999-07-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that time</TIMEX2>, Concorde planes belonging to British Airways have
been involved in minor incidents.

British Airways and Air France are the only two companies that
operate Concorde planes.

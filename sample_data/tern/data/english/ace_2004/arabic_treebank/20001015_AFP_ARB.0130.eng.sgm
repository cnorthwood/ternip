Asia 2000: New Saudi Coach and al-Jaber and al-Daei Optimistic
</HEADLINE>

Beirut 10-15 (AFP) -

Coach Nasser Jawher who has been appointed to supervise the Saudi
soccer team in place of Czech Milan Machala, who was sacked today
Sunday, said he "values the trust placed in him to complete the
mission in the Asian Nations Championship."


Prince Sultan Ben Fahed, president of the Youth Bureau and president
of the Saudi Association, issued an order sacking Machala after the
title-holding Saudi team lost 1-4 to its Japanese counterpart
yesterday Saturday in the group three competitions held at Saida
stadium.


Jawher added "there is confidence in the Saudi team but there is
always a possibility that the coach does not work out and is replaced
by another with a positive outcome among the team's ranks; this is
what has happened with the Saudi players."


He carried on "changing the coach has raised the players' morale and
al-Akhdhar will play a good match against the Qatari team which is
also a strong and skilled team."


Forward Sami al-Jaber, a professional with English club
Wolverhampton, said "we players are not used to responding negatively
or positively to the sacking of a coach. Discussion about this sort
of issue is the matter of the bosses of the Saudi team and
Association officials."


He added "this sort of thing happens in top international teams and
clubs, as happened with Wanderley Luxumburger who was sacked from
training the Brazilian team, and with Italian Gianluca Vialli who
discharged from training English team Chelsea, as a result of their
poor results, because change is sometimes important."


Al-Jaber attributed the harsh defeat to the Japanese team to a "bad
day" and said "it's not the end of the world and our preparations for
the next two matches with Qatar and Uzbekistan are excellent."


On the Saudi team's possibility of holding on to the title and
whether the defeat by Japan would lessen its chances, he said
"winning the next two matches guarantees us a place in the
competition because without this, we are not worthy of defending our
title," and added "losing a match does not mean the end of the
championship."


For his part, the team's goalkeeper Mohamed al-Daei said "in spite of
the defeat by Japan, I am optimistic after Machala's dismissal from
his post."


He went on "the defeat does not mean we have lost our title, our
morale is still high and the next match will definitely be better
than the one before."


Al-Daei said that changes in the squad's formation was "the
responsibility of the technical management and new coach."

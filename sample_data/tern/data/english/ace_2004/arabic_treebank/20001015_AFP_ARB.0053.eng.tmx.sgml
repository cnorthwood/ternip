Beirut <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">10-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

The Saudi Soccer Federation sacked the team's Czech coach Milan
Machala from his post <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> and appointed his assistant,
Nasser Jawhar, in his place.


The title-holding Saudi team suffered a bitter defeat (1-4) against
its Japanese counterpart in its first match in the championship
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>.


The Youth and Sports Bureau in Saudi Arabia released a statement
saying: "Prince Sultan Ben Fahd, president of the Youth and Sports
Bureau and president of the Saudi Soccer Federation, has issued a
decision by order of which Czech coach Machala has been discharged
and Nasser Jawhar has been placed in charge of training the team
during the championship."


He carried on: "This decision is the result of the Saudi Federation
ensuring the best technical conditions for the team in order to
reflect the true level of Saudi soccer."


In a telephone call with Agence France Presse at his hotel, Machala
refused to give his opinion regarding the decision and said "no
comment."


Machala is the first victim of the 12th Asian Nations Cup finals
hosted by Lebanon until <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this October 29</TIMEX2> as the Japanese blow was
fatal, especially since the Saudi team holds the title from the
<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-15" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">previous</TIMEX2> series in the Emirates in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>.


Machala took over training the Saudi team in <TIMEX2 val="1999-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">February 1999</TIMEX2> and led it
in the Continents Championship hosted by Mexico in <TIMEX2 val="1999-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July of <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that year</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>.


Machala is considered one of the best-known coaches in the Gulf
region and has achieved remarkable results with the Kuwaiti team,
which he led to win the Gulf Cup on two occasions and to take fourth
place in the last Asian Nations Championship in the Emirates, as well
as second place in the Asian Games in Bangkok in <TIMEX2 val="1998-10" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late 1998</TIMEX2>.

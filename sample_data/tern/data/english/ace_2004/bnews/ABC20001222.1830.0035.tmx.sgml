<TURN>
reporter: peter, senator john ashcroft is clearly the
president-elect's most controversial nominee to <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-22T18:30:35.68" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="this was tagged on analogy to what it means, 'before now'. But it's admittedly a stretch to do this.">date</TIMEX2>. many of his
positions are bound to upset democrats. he said ash krauflt would
serve everyone. 
<TURN>
he will be faithful to the law, pursuing justice without favor. 
<TURN>
reporter: the american conservative union gives him a top approval
rating, he has voted against some tobacco regulations, against
expanding hate crime legislation and against allowing abortionness
military hospitals. a record that troubles most democratic
constituencies. 
<TURN>
for a president-elect who is committed to uniting the country and
not dividing it, this nomination is one of the most divisive he
could have chosen. 
<TURN>
we are tremendously concerned that this is a harbinger of things to
come. 
<TURN>
reporter: mr. ashcroft has also angered civil rights groups he
blocked the nomination of missouri supreme court judge ronnie white
to the federal bench. judge white was the first black member of
missouri's supreme ashcroft said the judge was soft on criminals. 
<TURN>
he had his reasons for blocking a single nomination. and i thought
about that, and i looked at the facts, and i listened to him, and
there's no question in my mind that this is a person who believes in
civil rights for all citizens. 
<TURN>
reporter: if he is confirmed, the outgoing senator said he would be
an effective attorney general. 
<TURN>
i will enforce the laws of the united states of america with
integrity. 
<TURN>
reporter: ashcroft said his <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-22T18:30:35.68" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> loss in the u.s. senate race has
given him <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time to reflect</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
political defeat brings more than emotion and pain. it brings
perspective. and <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, for janet and me, it brings a renewed and
noble call to public service. 
<TURN>
reporter: now this is the first nomination to have been even
middlely controversial. but it does go a long way to satisfy the
conservative wing of mr. bush's party. and peter, he'll need them
when he begins to govern. 
<TURN>
thank you very much, mike von fremd in texas <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-22TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>.

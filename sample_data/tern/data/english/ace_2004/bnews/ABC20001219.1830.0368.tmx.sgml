the bridgestone/firestone company <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> blamed a combination of
factors for the flawed tires linked to more than 150 deaths.
firestone says there was a design flaw. the pockets between the
tread on the tire shoulder are too steep. the company also blamed
consumers who underinflate their tires. ford -- for recommending a
low tire pressure and the manufacturing process at one plant in
decatur, illinois. abc's bob jamieson is in decatur <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-19TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
few workers were inside the decatur plant <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, virtually closed
for <TIMEX2 val="P2W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W51" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next two weeks</TIMEX2> because firestone sales have plemted.
firestone's finding that the process, not the quality of workmanship
that brought about the failures has brought a sense of relief. many
feared that firestone would close the plants for work. 
<TURN>
it's always been a concern, being pointed to and singled out as a
problem plant. 
<TURN>
firestone is decatur's third-largest employer. though one-fourth of
the workers were laid off, the tiremaker still employs 1,400. 
<TURN>
it's very good news. it's very good news for us. 
<TURN>
economic development director richard eggars lobbied firestone to
keep the plant open. 
<TURN>
in terms of payroll and selective services, firestone infuses
approximately $5 million <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a month</TIMEX2> into the local economy. 
<TURN>
but in the tidy, modest neighborhoods where firestone workers live,
the damage has already been done. until the problems, firestone was
a family business for the coppenbargers. richard and shirley,
together, have <TIMEX2 val="P60Y" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">nearly 60 years on the job</TIMEX2>. richard jr. had <TIMEX2 val="P14M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="context says this ended in october">14
months</TIMEX2>, before he was laid off in <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">october</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
the job -- it's a big history here in the family, so to speak,
following my parents here. myob meant more to me than just a
paycheck. 
<TURN>
i am worried. i'd like to finish out until my actual retirement.
when i was really ready to quit. but, yeah, i have some doubts. 
<TURN>
it is an uncertain <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">christmas</TIMEX2> here. the report absolves the workers,
they know their jobs will only be safe if firestone restores faith
in its products and sells more tires. bob jamieson, abc news,

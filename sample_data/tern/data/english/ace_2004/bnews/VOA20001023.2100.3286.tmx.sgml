<TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This month</TIMEX2>'s visit of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to
Washington is further evidence of the strengthening ties between the
United States and Bangladesh. It follows a visit <TIMEX2 val="2000-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last March</TIMEX2> by
President Bill Clinton to Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital. That was
the first time a US President had visited Bangladesh. The US is
Bangladesh's largest trading partner and foreign investor. US
investment in Bangladesh has increased over <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past four years</TIMEX2> from
20 million dollars to around 800 million dollars. Prime Minister
Hasina and President Clinton expressed the hope that this trend will
continue. It will depend on the implementation of investor-friendly
policies. Both the US government and American businesses, welcomed
the willingness of Bangladesh to embrace innovative approaches
towards sustainable economic growth. Among other things, the US has
worked with Bangladesh to establish the Tropical Forest Conservation
Fund, the first of its kind in the world. The Fund will make it
possible for Bangladesh to redirect some debt repayment money to
projects and at preserving unique Eco-systems and protecting the
environment. The Bangladesh government also deserves credit for
making significant progress toward eliminating child labor in the
garment industry. The US is committed to working with Bangladesh on
this and other core labor standards including freedom of association
and collective bargaining. In addition to growing economic ties, the
US and Bangladesh share a commitment to democracy at home and to
meeting responsibilities abroad. Bangladesh is one of the largest
contributors to international peacekeeping operations. Its personnel
have served with US forces in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo.
Bangladesh is also the first South Asian nation to ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. President Clinton and Prime Minister
Hasina agreed that it is essential for the US and Bangladesh to
coordinate positions on major issues, that come before the United
Nations and other international bodies. As President Clinton has
said, the US and Bangladesh grow closer <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2>, through expanding
trade, through the Internet revolution and through a shared interest
in building a world more peaceful, more tolerant, more prosperous
and more free.

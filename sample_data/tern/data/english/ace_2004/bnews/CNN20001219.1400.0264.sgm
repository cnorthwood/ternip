while much of the country is in a deep freeze, an annual report on
the climate shows the united states has had its share of warm
weather this year. natalie pawelski has details. 
<TURN>
look outside right now and you might not believe it. but snow or no,
around the globe the year 2000 is one of the warmest on record. 
<TURN>
for the globe as a whole, we're looking at around the fifth warmest
year on record. 
<TURN>
with two weeks to go, all the returns aren't all in yet. but weather
pundits are projecting a swing to the warm on the domestic front,
too. from january through october in the united states, this year
was the hottest on record, featuring widespread wildfires and
drought. as the effects of the la ni a weather system disappeared,
things cooled down at year's end. but even so, the national oceanic
and atmospheric administration figures the year will go into the
american record books somewhere between the and the hottest on u.s.
record. 
<TURN>
we are seeing global warming. the scientists tell us they simply
cannot explain the patterns of temperature that we see and the
trends without including the impacts of human intervention and the
climate. 
<TURN>
global warming won't keep you cozy over the next few months, though.
forecasters are calling for colder-than-average temperatures in the
midwest and mountain west, warmer in the southern tier of states.
over all, a more-or-less normal winter. but normal may not be what
you think. 
<TURN>
most people, when they think of normals, think of the last three
years and it's been pretty mild the last three years. 
<TURN>
translation, for most americans -- bundle up, and have shovels and
sleds at the ready. natalie pawelski, cnn.

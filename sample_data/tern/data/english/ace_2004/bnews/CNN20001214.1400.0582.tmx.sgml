you don't need to be able to smell or see air pollution to die from
it. that's from a survey of the nation's 20 largest cities conducted
by the johns hopkins school of public health. it finds small
particles less than one-fifth the width of a human hair are enough
to raise the death rate. the study supports federal air quality
standards set <TIMEX2 val="1987" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">13 years ago</TIMEX2>. the pollution comes from sources
including power plants, agriculture and even from bits of car brakes
and tires.

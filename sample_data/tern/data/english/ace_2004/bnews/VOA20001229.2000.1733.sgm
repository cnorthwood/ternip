Britain's Millennium Dome will close down this coming Monday after a
year of mishaps. Officials at London's Millennium Dome say the
structure will close down after a final of New Year's Eve party.
They say it will be likely sold to a developer and be turned into a
Technology Park. Problems riddled the Dome even before its grand
opening last New Year's Eve. Construction delays and cost-over runs
hurt the project, which was originally expected to cost at least 1
billion 300 million dollars. Dome officials had to seek an
additional 265 million dollars to complete the structure.

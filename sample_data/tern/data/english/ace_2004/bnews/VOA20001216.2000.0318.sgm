Tornadoes have hit the Southern State of Alabama as rain, hail and
snow continued to pound the United States. Warren Beck is the Mayor
of one hard hit Alabama town. 
<TURN>
We are used to floods, our city's been flooded two or three times
and of course we are close to the Gulf where we're used to
hurricanes but we are kind of low, we're a low city and we are not
used to tornadoes. 
<TURN>
At least five people were reported killed in Alabama, thirty injured
when a series of twisters struck parts of the rural State.
Meanwhile, in the Central United States from Texas in the South to
the Northern Plains, North Dakota, hundreds of thousands of people
remained without electricity. I am Dave Deforest, VOA News.

Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has staged a major military
staff reshuffle to remove officers associated with long time ruler
Slobodan Milosevic. The President has retired fourteen senior
officers from active duty. These include Admiral Milanzech, Head of
the Navy, General Gezafarcus, Chief of military intelligence and
General Vragulyuv Voidanich, a former Defense Minister. In the
meantime, a disputed area in Southern Serbia's Presavo valley has
reopened to traffic after Serb police and Albanian rebel fighters
agreed to dismantle two roadblocks.

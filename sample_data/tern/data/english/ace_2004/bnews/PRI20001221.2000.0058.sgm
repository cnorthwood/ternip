From NPR News in Washington, I am Corey Flintoff. President-elect
George W. Bush formally resigned today as governor of Texas. He said
that his six years in office have been a tribute to bipartisan
efforts with the legislature. He said Texas has made steady progress
in improving education, the criminal justice system and tax reform.

the nation's highest court will take up the case <TIMEX2 val="2000-W48" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next week</TIMEX2>. that
development may not be as significant as it seems. joining me <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-25T18:45:11.85" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> is
law professor rick pildes. a consultant to nbc news. could a
decision from the u.s. supreme court settle this case once and for
all? 
<TURN>
at this stage, any decision from the u.s. supreme court is almost
certainly not going to provide a final resolution of this election
dispute. indeed, the issue is so narrow <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-25T18:45:11.85" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> before the supreme court
that chfr way the court rules, it will likely have only the most
marginal impact on what's going on in florida. even if the bush
campaign prevails before the supreme court, it simply means we will
move more quickly into the contest phase of the litigation or the
next stage of the litigation. 
<TURN>
but you believe the fact that the u.s. supreme court just decided to
hear this case is a partial victory for both bush and gore. 
<TURN>
it is a partially victory for both sides. for <TIMEX2 val="P2W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W47" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last two weeks</TIMEX2>,
the central constitutional argument the bush campaign has been
making to the federal courts is, stop these manual recounts <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-25T18:45:11.85" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>.
they violate the constitution. the u.s. supreme court refused to
hear that part of the case, agreeing with all the other federal
judges who have unanimously held that <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-25T18:45:11.85" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="interpreted this as 'now'">this</TIMEX2> is not <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="negative, so didn't give it a val">the proper time
for federal court intervention</TIMEX2>. so in that sense, a victory for the
gore campaign. for the bush campaign, a victory in the willingness
of the supreme court to play some role in overseeing the florida
system and the florida judicial decision making process. 
<TURN>
whatever the supreme court decides this time, you say this case
could come back before the u.s. supreme court again? 
<TURN>
john, if the supreme court of the united states is to play a final
and decisive role in this dispute, that role is going to come at the
end of the florida judicial process. not at this stage. 
<TURN>
law professor rick pildes, thank you.

US Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson has extended an emergency order
to keep electricity flowing to California. The measure will require
Western suppliers to sell power to the State for at least another
week. As we hear from Michael Sullivan, the official also proposed
an energy price cap for the West, but the suggestion had a mixed
response from Western Governors.

The extension of the Federal order will require power suppliers in
the West to keep sending their surplus electricity to California.
Electrical resources in the West Coast State are stretched to their
limit with a looming threat of rolling blackouts. California's
utility companies are not able to generate all the power their
customers need, so they have turned to outside suppliers and in the
face of rising prices the State's two largest utility firms have
sunk more than eight billion dollars in debt. Suppliers outside
California had threatened to cut off the power, afraid that the cash
strapped utilities were not able to pay for it. The emergency order
last week and the extension announced in Denver at a meeting of
Western Governors will keep electricity flowing to California
through the middle of next week. The crisis began three years ago
when California imposed a price freeze on its private utility firms
to protect consumers while the State deregulates its energy sector.
But the lifting of market controls led to wild price fluctuations on
the wholesale market. This was made worse by several factors. No new
generating stations have been built in the State in recent years and
some existing generators are offline for repairs. At the same time
California has been growing. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says
it is a case of demand outpacing supplies.

I know in California alone in the last year electricity demand has
increased 13%.

California's wholesale electricity prices, which had been capped at
250 dollars per megawatt hour in a regulated market, have peaked
under deregulation at 1400 dollars per megawatt hour. With the
current price freeze, utilities have been prevented from passing
along the increase to consumers. Wednesday, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson suggested a new price cap for electricity throughout the
Western States. Oregon's Governor supports the idea, some other
Western leaders are not convinced that a price cap will solve the
problem. Energy suppliers oppose a cap, saying instead they need
incentives to build more generating stations. Last week Federal
regulators imposed a so called soft cap on California, which
requires power firms to justify prices above 150 dollars per
megawatt hour. The measure does not however prevent them from
charging above that level. One large utility company, Southern
California Edison says it may have to file for bankruptcy unless
government officials can offer some relief. The privately owned
company is now three and a half billion dollars in debt. Consumer
activists are skeptical. They know the utility recently declared a
dividend for its stockholders, but Edison's Tom Higgins says the
firm cannot continue to pay high prices for electricity while
keeping prices low for its customers.

Our books are an open matter, it's not hard for anybody to see. They
can talk to the banks themselves and see that you know, clearly we
don't have the ability to do this. We don't print money in the
basement.

California's Governor this week warned that intermittent cutoffs of
power around the State may begin as early as next week if nothing
more is done to alleviate the crisis. Mike O' Sullivan, VOA News,

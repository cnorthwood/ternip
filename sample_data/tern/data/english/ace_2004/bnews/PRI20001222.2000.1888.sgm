The Palestinian suicide bomber had explosives strapped to his body.
He blew himself up at an outdoor cafe frequented by Israeli soldiers
near a Jewish settlement. Three Israelis were wounded. In other
violence, a Palestinian worker was shot dead in the Gaza Strip and
in the West Bank, another Palestinian, a teenager, was shot by
Israeli soldiers during clashes. Tensions were at a peak across the
Palestinian areas because this is the holiest day in the Muslim
calendar and the Israelis had banned Muslims under the age of 45 and
in some cases 35 from praying at Jerusalem's holy sites. Hillary
Anderson, BBC News, Jerusalem.

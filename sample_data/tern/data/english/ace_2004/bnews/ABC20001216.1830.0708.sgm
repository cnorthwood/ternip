this week, israel began opening its borders, just slightly, so that
some palestinians could go back to work. officials say the block
over the past two months has been necessary for security, but for
palestinians in gaza and the west bank, it has been an economic
nightmare. here's abc's gillian findlay. 
<TURN>
this is how bad it has gotten for ahmad al-dour. out of work, out of
savings, he is now trying to sell one of the few valuables he has
left. the most important thing is to buy milk for the children, says
this father of two. i don't care about the price. i just need to
sell it. these days, gaza's central market is filled with people who
need to sell. tv's, stereos, even bicycles mohammed's parents told
him they needed the money for food. israel says it closed its
borders for security reasons, but the economic impact here has been
devastating. it's not just that tens of thousands of palestinians
who used to work in israel are unemployed, construction in gaza has
all but stopped. israel has blocked cement supplies. gas is also in
short supply, and from time to time, so is food. according to the
united nations, in just three months, the number of palestinians
living below the poverty line has risen by 50%. one in three
palestinians now live on less than $2 a day. their economy, which
had been growing, now loses close to $9 million a day. 
<TURN>
i really don't think we have much longer than the end of january
before real disaster starts hitting from the economic point of view. 
<TURN>
five years ago bashar al-masri gave up a successful washington
investment career to return to ramallah and help build the new
palestinian state. business was good, he says, until the
palestinians started their uprising. israel began shooting back. 
<TURN>
the bullet came in here and hit the wall right here. 
<TURN>
and all of mr. al-masri's investors fled. soon, he says, he will
have no choice but to lay off his staff. making more people
unemployed, more people desperate. 
<TURN>
if the israelis think that things are going to get better, they are
going to get much, much worse because you are going to have many
more people who are hopeless. 
<TURN>
hopeless, and angry. israel says it wants security. palestinians
say, strangling them economically is only going to make things
worse. gillian findlay. abc news, ramallah.

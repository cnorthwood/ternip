An International team is developing a vaccine against Alzheimer's
disease and they are trying it out on a new and improved mouse model
of the onus. Correspondent Jessica Berman explains.

Scientists working on a vaccine against Alzheimer's give a progress
report this week in the journal Nature. The vaccine has only been
tested in mice that have been bred to have a form of Alzheimer's
disease very similar to that of humans. According to University of
Toronto researcher David Westaway, another team of scientists last
year took the first step toward an Alzheimer's vaccine. That team
injected a small amount of Amyloid protein, which accumulates in
brains of Alzheimer's patients and injected it in the mice's
abdomens. The injection prompted the animals' immune systems to kick
in and clean up the Amyloid deposits in the rodents' brains. But
those mice never had any difficulties with learning and memory. In
Dr. Westaway's view, this made the vaccine sort of pointless, since
learning and memory problems are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.
So his research team decided to test a vaccine in mice with
Alzheimer's more like that seen in many humans.

Now normally Alzheimer's disease might have this strong deficit in
learning and memory, actually in our experiments the ability to
navigate around a small tank of water using cues pinned up on the
wall of the testing room. And once we started immunizing the mice
against the Alzheimer disease peptides then the performance showed a
dramatic improvement such as they came very close to the performance
of regular mice that have not been genetically engineered to
resemble Alzheimer's disease.

A second Alzheimer's vaccine experiment was also reported in the
journal Nature by a group of University of South Florida scientists
in Tampa. In a third published paper researchers formally described
how they genetically engineered a mouse model of Alzheimer's similar
to the human disease, complete with memory and learning impairment.
Neuroscientist Paul Chapman of the Cardiff School of Bio-Sciences in
Wales, wrote an article in the magazine commenting on the
developments.

We all know we've got a long way to go before we have a cure for
Alzheimer's disease. But in order to get there we need to have
confidence that we understand the disease and that we have what we
call a model system for predicting whether these treatments will
work. And the fact that these papers are now showing us that
behaviorally these models do what humans do, that is they behave
more poorly as they age if they have Alzheimer's genes, and that
these treatments can reverse that, it just means we have that much
more confidence these treatments will work in humans.

In a related development an International team of researchers
reports in the latest issue of the Journal Science, that a genetic
mutation in an area of chromosome ten may put some people at
increased risk of late onset Alzheimer's disease, the most common
form of dementia in the elderly. Jessica Berman, VOA News,

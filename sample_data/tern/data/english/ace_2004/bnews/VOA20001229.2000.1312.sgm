On the ski slopes Christian Hummer edged fellow Norwegian Biarka
Engenvick after a thrilling duel down the stretch of a World Cup
Nordic combined ski sprint event in Norway Friday. Hummer trailed
Engenvick by 21 seconds at the start of the 7.5 kilometer cross
country race, that's because Hummer finished third in the morning
jumping portion on Little Hummer's Olympic Hill. However, Hummer
overtook Austrian David Kriner who placed second in the ski jump
after about one kilometer, two kilometers later Hummer approached
Engenvick and they skied together the rest of the way. It was only
the second World Cup win for Hummer who's been on the National team
for five years. And that's Sports, I am Dave Byrd.

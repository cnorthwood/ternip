in other news today, the annual christmas migration is under way
from every part of the country, and many other parts of the world.
people are trying to reach their people somewhere else. new york's
la guardia airport has been a nightmare this year, but there is some
good news. even with the bad weather and the number of people
flying, the industry says 2 million in the u.s. alone, things are
not as bad as they might be. here's abc's bob jamieson. 
<TURN>
reporter: at chicago's o'hare airport, ground zero for air travel
troubles all year -- there was a holiday surprise. 220,000
passengers jammed the airport, but with good weather and labor peace
at united airlines, there were few delays. 
<TURN>
we're actually on time today. a rare thing that happens here. 
<TURN>
reporter: there were scattered delays in philadelphia, new york and
boston. snow fell all day long in the northeast, causing poor
visibility, but little stayed on the ground. across the country,
skies were clear at almost every major airline hub and little change
is expected tomorrow. which was particularly welcome at atlanta's
hartsfield airport. earlier this week, bad weather added to a labor
dispute between delta airlines and its pilots caused scores of
cancellations and hundreds of delays. still, delta said it was
forced to cancel 5% of its flights today, because some pilots
refused overtime. 
<TURN>
this journey started at 6:45 a.m., and it doesn't look like there's
any promise of getting out of here tonight. 
<TURN>
reporter: analysts say travelers should still consider today an
early christmas present. 
<TURN>
anybody that thinks this will be the way that air travel is through
the rest of the holidays and into the year 2001 are in for a real
surprise. this is not at all the way things usually are. 
<TURN>
reporter: which may explain why so many, almost 45 million people,
are traveling by car this weekend, up sharply from last year. and
few problems are reported. 
<TURN>
all aboard. 
<TURN>
reporter: amtrak is expected to have more passengers too. 
<TURN>
i take the train because it's a lot more sane than flying. 
<TURN>
reporter: the rail carrier is adding 16,000 seats in the northeast
alone. many for passengers who decided not to take a chance on the
weather or the airlines. bob jamieson, abc news, new york. we all
know it pays to keep checking. abcnews.com has up to the minute
reporting on travel in the country.

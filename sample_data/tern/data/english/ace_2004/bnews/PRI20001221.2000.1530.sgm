Not a whole lot happens in Dornoch, but tomorrow the small Scottish
town will be the center of the universe. At least that's the
conclusion you might reach from seeing the hundreds of journalists
and photographers camped out there. They are all vying for the story
of the millennium, which is, as if you didn't know, tomorrow's
wedding of singer Madonna and filmmaker Guy Ritchie. This amazing,
thrilling and fantastic story began today with the christening of
the couple's four-month old boy 'Rocco.' Reporter Garith McClain is
covering the story for the London based Guardian Newspaper. Now
Garith it sounds like the Scottish media have all gone mad. Why this
interest in an American pop star? 
<TURN>
We are surprised that we have such an American pop star in Scotland
itself, never mind up in Dornoch which is near Inverness, which is
the back of beyond even to most Scottish people. I think it's like
the wilds of Washington State. I think it's the best comparison I
can make. 
<TURN>
So you are saying there aren't Hollywood stars and starlets there,
there is not a whole lot going on. 
<TURN>
Just the howling wind and the pouring rain otherwise. 
<TURN>
And a lot of fog I guess now. Apparently, it's going to be hard to
get a good camera angle for the wedding. 
<TURN>
Apparently so, yes, and the guests have been warned not to keep
cameras in their kilts. 
<TURN>
Cameras in their kilts? 
<TURN>
yes. 
<TURN>
If one would so desire. 
<TURN>
Well apparently, photo lens in your pocket or are you just pleased
to see me. Yes, guests have been warned not to bring in cameras in
their kilts and people are having their kilts examined and
looked-up, which if you know anything about Scotland and Scottish
men aren't suppose to wear anything under their kilts. 
<TURN>
Yeah. 
<TURN>
A bit of an eyeful. 
<TURN>
Yes, I can 
<TURN>
He's got a camera there! 
<TURN>
That's an interesting little anecdote, isn't it? Well, when this
sort of thing happens in a small community and I guess that's a
under statement in this case, whether or not it all succeeds depends
on how well some of the local people can keep secrets. Are people
kind of, you know, in the fold on this, or are there things being
leaked around to press here and there? 
<TURN>
Well Skibo Castlee , where the wedding is being held, is very
discrete. There have been a lot of celebrity weddings there but none
as big as this admittedly. But within the town there was a piano
being rented out from a piano shop in Aberdeen, which is sort of
reasonably nearby and it was leaked that this was the piano that
someone was going to play at the wedding. Reportedly, it was Elton
John who was going to play a song for Guy and the shop was inundated
when this was leaked and people just wanting to touch the piano that
was going to be in the same room as Madonna and Guy Ritchie. 
<TURN>
I imagine the locals could be kind of swooning for quite a while
because Sting, who I guess might be singing at the wedding, his wife
introduced the couple, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Robin Williams,
George Clooney, any other people around there are specially fond of? 
<TURN>
Well, I think that is the most unusual thing about it. I mean I have
some friends who live up in there next to the woods and people are
just surprised that they would choose this little tiny village in
Scotland. It is the juxtaposition of that glamour, I mean a Gwyneth
Paltrow in Inverness, it just doesn't sound what they are thinking
about. And, of course, Stella McCartney is there too and apparently
Celine Dion. But it is pretty amazing, all these Hollywood stars in
this quiet, sleepy village that isn't really famous for anything. 
<TURN>
So this must be a real boom to the local economy? 
<TURN>
Oh absolutely, I mean it's been estimated that 3 million pounds,
which is about 5 million dollars, will be made over the next few
weeks in Dornoch just from journalists and celebrities and sort of
sightseers I guess coming to see where Madonna got married. 
<TURN>
Gosh, this must be you know about five thousand times the local
budget there. 
<TURN>
Yeah, absolutely. I don't think they'll know what to do with all
that money out there. There is only so many sheep you can buy. But
the Scottish Tourist Board are also planning on cashing in on it and
they're estimating some 60 million dollars will be made over the
next few years, just with people coming to see the sight of Madonna
and Guy's wedding. 
<TURN>
Garith McClain, covering the Madonna-Guy Ritchie wedding for the
London based Guardian newspaper speaking to us from Edinburgh,
Scotland. Thank you, Garith. 
<TURN>
Thank you.

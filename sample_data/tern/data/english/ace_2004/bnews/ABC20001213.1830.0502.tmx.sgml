it will be <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a long time that it's forgotten that mr. bush won this
the way he did in the supreme court</TIMEX2>. yes, it took a while <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last night</TIMEX2>
to sort out precisely what the court had decided by such a narrow
margin. it is case number 00949. and it will be dissected for <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">years
to come</TIMEX2>. here's abc's jackie judd.

the supreme court cleared the way for george w. bush to become
president by interpreting the principle of "equal protection under
the law" in a way it had never done before. equal protection cases
often deal with discrimination based on race. here, the court
applied it to counting voters' ballots. 
<TURN>
it's <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-13T18:38:22.25" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> become clear, that as a matter of federal law, there have
to be reasonably uniform standards for collecting people's votes and
for interpreting those votes. 
<TURN>
in fact, equal protection became the single issue this divided court
could find a majority to support. 
<TURN>
this was a stabilizing decision that restored order to a very
chaotic situation. 
<TURN>
and with that in mind, the justices -- in a highly unusual move --
said their ruling "is limited to the <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-13T18:38:22.25" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">present</TIMEX2> circumstances" only.
meaning it applies just to bush v. gore. not likely say, say many
legal experts. 
<TURN>
what they've done <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-13T18:38:22.25" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> amounts to, what could be a very important
general principle, and take it right back again immediately by
saying, "well, we don't intend to enforce this in any other case." 
<TURN>
even those who support aspects of the ruling still expect it to
affect many states with election laws similar to florida. 
<TURN>
that raises a host of new questions, not just about recounts, but
about different voting machines and differences between one city and
another city within the same state. even it raises questions about
differences between citizens of different states. 
<TURN>
this historic decision will certainly be remembered as the one that
put a president in the white house. but it may also become a
decision that expands the judiciary's role in <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-13T18:38:22.25" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">future</TIMEX2> elections as
well. jackie judd, abc news. the supreme court.

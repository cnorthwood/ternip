a new study from the securities and exchange commission is expected
to show that investors get worse prices when they trade on the
nasdaq nan on the new york stock exchange. that's according to "the
wall street journal." the study suggests that the differences
between the two exchanges cause the disparity. the nasdaq is based
on marketmakers while the auction market of the nyse is intended to
eliminate a middle man.

From BBC News in London, I am Gregor Craigy for The World. A
Singapore Airlines 747 flying from Taiwan to Los Angeles has
crashed. Flight SQ006 was carrying 179 passengers and crew when it
crashed in flames shortly after take off. At least 65 people are
known to have been killed and around 30 passengers remain
unaccounted for. David Chezan reports.

Survivors from the Singapore Airlines flight described how the plane
was taxing down the runway when there was a loud noise and the
aircraft split in two. An American passenger said he had almost
decided not to board the plane because of what he called
unbelievable wind and rain. Survivors described how the tail section
turned over several times, leaving passengers hanging by their
safety belts, some were quickly engulfed by flames. One survivor
described saying a man, as he put it, "lit up like a torch." "Flames
shot up right next to me and there was jet fuel all over the place,"
he said. David Chezan, BBC News.

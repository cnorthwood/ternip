especially dangerous volcano because it of its steep slopes. it
could potentially wipe out everything its path. 40,000 people live
in the path. here at the national natural disaster prevention
center, they are working around the clock. it is here they take the
volcano's pulse, calling it unstable, saying popo is simply
recharging, getting ready to erupt again.

the mexican government is taking no chances. it sent out 1,000
troops to force an evacuation inside an eight-mile radius. <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>,
20,000 people in shelters, but another 20,000 refuse to leave,
worried about their corn harvests who -- or who would feed their
animals. if a major danger was to come, says this man, then we've
got to run. there's no other choice. scientists say popo has a huge
crater about half a mile across, about 300 feet deep and a lava dome
is building up like an upside down grapefruit. in contrast, mt.
saint helen had a dome, almost as if it was pregnant. randy white,
who has done on site studies of this mountain, monitors the rhythms.

it is blowing in its own way. it could get bigger. we don't know how

their crops with rain. <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>, they fear it will turn vengeful,

there were a couple of indications earlier about how important
social security has become as an issue in the presidential campaign.
everyone agrees it needs fixing and if it isn't reformed, it will
eventually run out of money. george w. bush wants to modernize
social security, as he puts it, by allowing workers to take a small
share of their social security, payroll tax, to increase themselves.
al gore wants to maintain the existing system. he says he would save
social security by reducing the national debt and giving social
security extra money. ax's john martin takes a closer look from the
battleground state of missouri. 
<TURN>
at a small robotics company in a st. louis suburb, the blumers,
father and son, work side by side. george bush's plan to allow them
to invest a small portion of their social security payroll taxes in
the stock market is where they part ways. 
<TURN>
i could do with it what i want. if i made a bad decision, then falls
back on me. and i don't have to complain about anybody else messin'
my money. 
<TURN>
it's retirement money. it's social security money. if you lose it,
it's gone. 
<TURN>
the issue comes down to this -- will voters believe al gore's
promise to protect social security the way it is? or will they take
a gamble and trust george bush's plan to privatize part of it? some
missouri voters are not sure social security will be there for them,
so they are ready to take a risk. mike dubis is 29, father three. 
<TURN>
giving all that money to uncle sam to earn his 2% on it or me
turning around making 27% or 30% on it, i'd have to go that way. 
<TURN>
that way was a simple appeal. 
<TURN>
i just want more of a say so of what i can do with my own money. 
<TURN>
at a union hall, retirees worry that bush is gambling with their
social security benefits. 
<TURN>
i don't think nobody has the option to take my social security and
invest it in nothing. it's mine! 
<TURN>
gore targets independents like hank and loretta goehring to drive
home the point that the bush plan will take $1 trillion out of the
system. they got a phone message by actor ed asner. 
<TURN>
hi, this is ed asner. 
<TURN>
but i don't think we have enough money to cover both promises. 
<TURN>
neither candidate says how he will guarantee social security's
<TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-31T18:45:41.13" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">future</TIMEX2>. and both resist saying it will cost more money. 
<TURN>
do you never see the need in <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-31T18:45:41.13" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the future</TIMEX2> to raise taxes or cut
benefits? 
<TURN>
i certainly hope not. 
<TURN>
an abc news poll shows voters divided on who will best protect
social security, but 58% support a plan like bush's. in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this era of
stock market wealth</TIMEX2>, they see his idea as an opportunity, not the
end of social security. john martin, abc news, st. louis. 
<TURN>
there are a lot of complexities in social security in both of these
plans. if you go to our website, abc.com, that may help.

the "jingle cats" are putting a new twist on the term "meow mix."
denise dillon introduces us to a group of singing felines with
several under their collars. 7777

if nine caroling cats crooning <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">christmas</TIMEX2> classics doesn't put you in
the <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">holiday</TIMEX2> mood, maybe nothing will. yes, it's <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that time of <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">year</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>.
the jingle cats are back, and can be found just about anywhere. they
have cassettes and and their very own video, which is also out on
dvd. the man behind the music, creator mike spalla, says he owes it
all to his cat, cheesepuff, and her finely tuned vocal cords.

i was hired to do some <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">christmas</TIMEX2> music, and it was just "jingle
bells," and i brought my cat with me to the studio, and i was
working on the song and the cat jumped up into the record booth and
started meowing along, meowing to me. 7777

cheesepuff and friends first clawed their way onto the music charts
in <TIMEX2 val="1993" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1993</TIMEX2> with the release of their "meowy christmas" cd, featuring 20
classic <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">christmas</TIMEX2> hits. it was such a success, <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the following year</TIMEX2>,
the feline group released another <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">holiday</TIMEX2> song collection, "here
comes santa claws." spalla says they have a following of some very
unique fans.

there's a certain kind of person that's in tune with a cat. they're
thoughtful. they must be more intelligent or something. 7777

the cats are such a hit, spalla has taken on a couple of new groups.
"jingle babies," and, of course, "jingle dogs." denise dillon,

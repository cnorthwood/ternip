Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are headed home with some ideas
put forward by President Clinton after failing to reach a
breakthrough in their talks with US officials in Washington. The
negotiators are expected to report back by <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> after
discussing the ideas with top officials. After a meeting at the
White House <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>, none of those involved in the talks would give
details about Mr. Clinton's ideas on how to break this stalemate and
proceed toward a peace settlement. After the meeting Israeli Foreign
Minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami would only say that formidable obstacles
remain. 
<TURN>
It's still too early to confirm, that is we need to deliberate
between ourselves on whether we see these ideas that were raised
here, as a basis for an end game.

Chief Palestinian negotiator Sayeeb Erekat told reporters that
serious differences continue concerning Jerusalem, refugee, security
and territorial issues. 
<TURN>
Major gaps still exist. <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-24TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This morning</TIMEX2> we've heard ideas from
President Clinton. We will convey to President Arafat and then we'll
take it from there as to what will be the next step. 
<TURN>
Mr. Clinton is working hard for a peace deal before he leaves office
<TIMEX2 val="2001-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next month</TIMEX2>. There are reports that he could meet separately with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, then decide if there was reason for a three way Summit, but
the White House is calling talks of such a Summit premature.

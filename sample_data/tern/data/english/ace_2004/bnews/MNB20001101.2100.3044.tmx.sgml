it either says a lot about the " getting elected in this country or
both, but jay leno has become a campaign stop in this country. our
report on the new trend fra david gregory. 
<TURN>
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">it</TIMEX2>'s <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">eight days before the election</TIMEX2>, and guess where george w. bush
is? 
<TURN>
hi. how many in your party? 
<TURN>
we like our champagne on ice, please. sorry i didn't name you vice
president. something about the background check. 
<TURN>
i think i would have a little bit of trouble. 
<TURN>
in a dead heat with al gore, <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> bush puts issues aside instead
playing for laughs with the <TIMEX2 val="TNI" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late night</TIMEX2> comedy. 
<TURN>
3, 2 -- 
<TURN>
hey, hi, governor bush. 
<TURN>
jay, you can't light that in here. the stuff in the closet is highly
flamabable. 
<TURN>
i think the word you're looking for is flammable. 
<TURN>
flamabable. 
<TURN>
flammable. 
<TURN>
jay, look at that sign. 
<TURN>
the campaign has hit the late show. both bush and al gore realize
there's votes to be had joking after dark. 
<TURN>
if you're elected president, how do you prepare yourself for <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the
next four years of jay's monologue</TIMEX2>.sory staff working on the jay
chip. 
<TURN>
really? 
<TURN>
in this case jay stands for you. any political offensive humor is
automatically -- 
<TURN>
oh, just wiped out. and you're not kidding. i can see that grin. 
<TURN>
why do you think it's so important to do these shows? 
<TURN>
i think it shows a different side -- at least it does for me. it
gives people a chance to show i know how to laugh. not only laugh
with people, i can laugh at myself, which sometimes i need to do
during the course of the campaign. 
<TURN>
it's an important way to communicate in a slightly different manner
to people that are really tuned in <TIMEX2 val="TNI" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every night</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
the odd thing about him is, in the dressing room, couldn't be looser
or funnier. 
<TURN>
you're under a lot of pressure. it's a tying race. here you're doing
schtick on jay leno. 
<TURN>
i know it. actually, i'm enjoying it. i like the man. i think he's a
unique person. i think it's important to have people who help
americans laugh. but this is a way for me to i think a leno show is
suitable to my personality. 
<TURN>
you can take it. you have a sense of humor. people say oh, not a bad
sport. because ultimately, we're not a country that values
intellectuals. we like personalities. and if have a good
personality, that seems good enough. 
<TURN>
that's scary. this is more scary. 
<TURN>
we'll be right back here's a hard-hitting question from karen. do
you keep your figure during the campaign? 
<TURN>
thank you, karen. i run actually. 
<TURN>
you do run. what do you do a mile in? 
<TURN>
<TIMEX2 val="PT7.5M" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about 7 1/2 minute</TIMEX2> miles. 
<TURN>
have you challenged al gore to a foot race? 
<TURN>
i would be willing to put it all on a foot race. 
<TURN>
really? oh. can you come back <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2>? wow. 
<TURN>
when it comes to <TIMEX2 val="TNI" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late night</TIMEX2> tv, the candidates may be eager to show
humor over substance. 
<TURN>
if you win, what's the first meal you will order as president. what
is the first meal? 
<TURN>
well, if it's as close as they are saying it is, breakfast. but if
it's -- if the returns come in <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-08TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="According to the context of the article, the election is on November 8. It's also unclear where the dialogue comes from if he isn't appearing on the show until tonight.">early election night</TIMEX2>, probably a
happy meal from mcdonald's. 
<TURN>
yeah? 
<TURN>
but critics question whether voters get cheated because the
politicians would rather face comics than tough questions. 
<TURN>
the two candidates, the voters are getting screwed! they're getting
cheated? they got screwed <TIMEX2 val="2000-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">six months ago</TIMEX2>. what are you talking
about? folks getting cheated. they've already been cheat the. they
don't even know it yet. 
<TURN>
what do you worry more, losing the election or having a joke fall
flat? 
<TURN>
i don't know i'll let you know after the show. 
<TURN>
i'm not asking you to vote as a citizen but as jay leno, who are you
dying to have in the white house? 
<TURN>
i would like to get an amendment and get clinton back. fat girls
under the desk. we don't see that again in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">our lifetime</TIMEX2>. in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">our
lifetime</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
it's all downhill from here. 
<TURN>
it's like "happy days" after the fonz left. it's potsy and rat of
mouth. that's the problem. we're losing the fonz.

For <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>'s musical closure, we meet a band that's just recorded
it's own rendition of a pop hit made famous by Sarah McClauclin.
It's only fair, the band called Solace helped McClauclin write the
Grammy winner 'I will remember you'. Solace, though, is not just
another folk pop band, it's really known for it's traditional Irish
music. The World's Stephen Snyder has our story.

Like the famous Irish group the Chieftains and Alton, the group
Solace frequently headlines in Celtic festivals. They bring
audiences to their feet with virtual self playing of traditional
fiddle tunes, jigs and reals. But unlike the other stars of the
Irish circuit, Solace got their start in the United States. Three
members of Solace, including superstar fiddler Winfred Horan are
Irish Americans, the remaining two are Irish transplants living in
New York city. Winfred Horan stepped into Irish music literally.
From childhood she competed in Irish step dancing competitions
winning nine North American titles. She also took up traditional
fiddle at a young age, but soon turned to classical violin. She
devoted <TIMEX2 val="P15Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">fifteen years</TIMEX2> to classical training and performance
including string quartets, orchestras and a stint with the Boston
Pops before returning to Irish music in <TIMEX2 val="199" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the early 90's</TIMEX2>. Flute player
Shamus Eagan comes from Pennsylvania. In Solace he serves as the
utility player, handling not only flute but also the Irish hand
drum, the Boran and the Indian pipes. And Eagan is the only American
ever to have won four all Ireland championships, for banjo, tin
whistle, flute and mandolin playing. Eagan's work on the film score
for the Brothers McMollin, let him to co-author a song with folk pop
diva Sarah McClauklin. On this new CD from Solace,' The hour before
dawn', Eagan and the group offer a traditional re-rendering of the
song McClauklin made famous, 'I will remember you'. That's Dierdre
Scandlin, the newest member of Solace, who came to the group just
<TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>. She says singing a song that Sarah McClauklin had already
recorded twice was a little intimidating. But the group made a
conscious attempt to come up with the version that would stand on
its own, and it does. For The World, I am Stephen Snyder.

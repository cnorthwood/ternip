<TEXT>
The Soviet Union prepares to withdraw Soviet troops stationed in
Poland starting in May of this year and withdraw completely before
the middle of 1994.


This is the suggestion put forward by Soviet side in Polish-Soviet
negotiations being held in Warsaw concerning issues of the Soviet
Union withdrawing troops from Poland and Russia's troops going across
the border.

Currently, there are about 50,000 Soviet troops stationed in Poland.

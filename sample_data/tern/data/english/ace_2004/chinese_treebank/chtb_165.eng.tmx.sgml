Mansion in the Pudong Lujiazui financial trading district, becoming
the third foreign capital bank to be approved to operate RMB business
and shift to Pudong.


At <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1997-04-03T10:41:51" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the moment</TIMEX2>, Shanghai already has 8 foreign capital banks approved
to operate RMB business. They are the US's Citibank, Hong Kong's
HSBC, Japan's Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank, Japan's Industrial Bank, the
Shanghai Branch of the Standard and Chartered Bank, Shanghai's BNP
Paris Bank, the Shanghai Branch of Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and
the Shanghai Branch of Japan's Sanwa Bank.

According to regulations, these 8 banks will all move to Pudong soon.


After the policy was formally announced for the Pudong Lujiazui
Financial Trade District to allow foreign capital banks to operate
RMB business, more than 40 foreign capital banks and financial
institutions have submitted applications to establish branches in
Pudong.


When selecting locations in Lujiazui, some foreign financial
institutions do not mind the real estate prices, but focus more on
whether the class of the building is compatible with the standing of
the company.

The Franklin Templeton Company, whose headquarters are in California,
the US, and has registered capital of 130 billion US dollars all
around the world, decided to establish its local China headquarters
in Pudong.

The president of the company and the Asian regional president
personally surveyed Pudong and decided to choose office locations in
the Shanghai Securities Building, which has a floor rate of more than
2700 US dollars per square meter.

<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1997-04-03T10:41:51" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2>, the Templeton Company has formally signed a contract, and bought
the floor area of the entire 18th floor of the Securities Building.


<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1997-04-03T10:41:51" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Currently</TIMEX2>, foreign-capital banks and financial institutions such as
Hong Kong's HSBC, the Shanghai Branch of the Japan Industrial Bank,
the Holland Co-operation Bank, Shanghai Branch of the Belgium Credit
Bank, etc., have successively settled down in the Lujiazui Financial
Trading District.

Soon, a large number of domestic and foreign financial institutions,
and large companies will also come to successively settle down,
including the finance street which has already formed in the Waitan
district, and the Shanghai central commercial district framework that
is forming.

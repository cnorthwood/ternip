According to the latest statistics data published by Finland Customs,
in <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2>, Finland's exports to Southeast Asia grew by 28%.


Up till <TIMEX2 val="1997-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October of last year</TIMEX2>, Finland's export volume to major
trading partners, such as Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Thailand,
Singapore, Malaysia etc., reached 10.7 billion Finland Marks (1
Finland Mark approximates 0.19 US dollar), which was equivalent to
gross exports of <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the whole year of 1996</TIMEX2>.

The proportion of Finland's exports to this region in its total
exports increased from 1% <TIMEX2 val="1988" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">ten years ago</TIMEX2> to 6.2%.

The main commodities Finland exports to this region are mechanical
and electronic industry products as well as transport equipment, etc.


At <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="the past year?">the same time</TIMEX2>, Finland's imports from Southeast Asia grew by 5%.

In <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="T-ERROR">recently years</TIMEX2>, Finland has been keeping an obvious trade surplus
in this region.


Finland Customs estimated that, the financial crisis in Southeast
Asia may weaken Finland's exports to this region, in particular, the
export of electromechanical products would be impacted.

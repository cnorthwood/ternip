Analysis: Mexico's Foreign Trade - between joy and sorrow

In <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2>, Mexico's total amount of foreign trade broke through 220
billion US dollars, which created a new historical record.

However, in reviewing Mexico's foreign trade situation <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, it
might be appropriate to say that it is between joy and sorrow.

The joy lies in that the total amount of foreign trade still
maintains a strong growth momentum, and has realized trade surpluses
for <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the third year in a row</TIMEX2>, whereas the sorrow is that the amount of
trade surplus has sharply reversed, and <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, a relatively large
deficit may appear.


According to official journals published <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-01-21" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> by Mexico's
Treasury Department, in <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2>, foreign trade continues to grow at high
speed, the total amount of imports and exports reached 220.178
billion US dollars, 18.85% higher than that of <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the previous year</TIMEX2>,
among which the amount of exports is 110.38 billion US dollars,
imports were 109.798 billion US dollars, being 15% and 22.7% higher
than that of <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2> respectively. The trade surplus was 582 million US
dollars.


Foreign trade occupies a pivotal position in Mexico's economy.

At <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-01-21" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">present</TIMEX2>, exports account for more than 30% of its GDP, which is
one of the primary economic growth forces.

After the outbreak of Mexico's financial crisis in <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2>, Mexico's
currency, the peso was greatly devalued, thus greatly strengthening
Mexico's export competitiveness.

In <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last several years</TIMEX2>, the government has been vigorously
supporting exports, and exports grew rapidly. In <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1995</TIMEX2>, the situation
of successive foreign trade deficit reversed, and up to <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-01-21" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, has
maintained trade surpluses for <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">three years in a row</TIMEX2>.


However, in <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past three years</TIMEX2>, Mexico's foreign trade surplus
showed a substantial degradation: 7.889 billion US dollars in <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1995</TIMEX2>,
6.424 billion US dollars in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>, and only 582 million US dollars
<TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>.

Especially deserving to be pointed out is that, after the first
<TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">monthly</TIMEX2> deficit in <TIMEX2 val="1997-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July last year</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="P5M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1997-08" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the rest of the year</TIMEX2> saw
successive <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">monthly</TIMEX2> deficits with the amounts of deficit almost
doubling, roaring from 20 million US dollars in <TIMEX2 val="1997-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July</TIMEX2> to 722 million
US dollars in <TIMEX2 val="1997-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December</TIMEX2>, reducing the <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">annual</TIMEX2> accumulative trade
surplus amount to a trivial number.


Local economic analysts felt that the trade deficit in <TIMEX2 val="1997-H2" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the second
half of last year</TIMEX2> was mainly due to an overly high import growth
rate, which is even higher than that of exports.

In <TIMEX2 val="1997-H2" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the second half of last year</TIMEX2>, the average growth rate of imports
was 6% to 7% higher than that of exports.

Among import sectors, swift growth comes mainly from imports of
consumer products and capital goods, 39.9% and 38.2% higher than that
of <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2> respectively.

The growth of imports of semi-finished products was up by 18.8%.

Secondly, the overly high valuation of the peso is also an
indispensable factor.

An overly high peso exchange rate stimulated imports, but hindered
exports.


It is commonly known that in <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2>, before the outbreak of the
financial crisis, the trade deficit was once as high as more than 18
billion US dollars. The huge trade deficit was one of the internal
reasons that triggered this crisis.

Hence, the trade situation <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2> has caused extreme concern among
people from economic circles, who even predicted that in <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2>,
foreign trade deficit would revive.

They pointed out that, <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, except for an overly high peso
exchange rate, exports would also face some new unfavorable factors.
For instance, Asian currency devaluation will decrease export
competitiveness, and the fall of oil price will significantly reduce
oil revenues.

Under these circumstances, if the import growth momentum cannot be
restrained, <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, a trade deficit of 4 to 5 billion US dollars
may appear.

"China's 'Two Congresses' were held at a very important historical
moment. Congresses proliferate the basic theme of maintaining
stability, and causing our investment confidence in China to greatly
increase.

"The President of Siemens (China) Company, Ltd., Kehenen made the
above comment while <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1997-03-09T10:50:59" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> receiving reporter interviews.

Congresses" with utmost passion. He gets the latest information on
the "Two Congresses" from papers and TV.


He said, prime minister Peng Li mentioned in the "Government Work
Report" that, priority must be on the development of infrastructure
and the economy of the Central and Western regions. This happens to

construction of the Three Gorges Project.


Kehenen said, whether a country has attractive power to foreign
investment lies on whether it has a stable political environment and
a healthy and complete legal system.

The National People's Congress meeting being held here has made
outstanding contributions to China's legal establishment.

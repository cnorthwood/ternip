million US dollars.

of the introduction of foreign investment, with expediting
infrastructure construction, expanding productivity distribution,
adjusting product structures and transforming traditional industries.

economic development of the whole province.

and actually utilized investments are 2.78 billion US dollars.

industrial projects in Jiangxi provide a broad investment market for
foreign companies.

Jiangxi, and the number of big multinational companies investing in
Jiangxi is increasing annually.

including transportation, energy, communication, mechanics,
electronics, etc., and foreign currency earned by foreign-invested
enterprises through exports is more than 1 billion US dollars.


At present, Jingdezhen airport and Ganzhou airport have started
operations. The Nanchang-Jiujiang highway, the Great Nanchang bridge,
etc. have all been put into use.

The program-controlled telephone and transmission systems of the

While delivering his appreciation speech, Xiaotong Fei said that "I
will never let down the encouragement given to me by this friendly
neighboring country. No matter how many years I still have allocated,
I will certainly conscientiously make use of every second to
diligently do good things to benefit Asian people, and even the
people of the world, so as to use the knowledge that mankind
accumulated to spur the present society to develop into a better
society."

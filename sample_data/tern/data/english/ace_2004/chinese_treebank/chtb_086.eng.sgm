Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 27, by wire (reporter

The lawsuit by Chinese enterprises suing the First National Bank of
America to compensate, after more than one year of tough litigation
by the "Duan & Duan Law Firm" in Shanghai, has reached a mediated
settlement in the US Federal District Court of New Mexico. The First
National Bank of America will totally compensate the three Chinese
enterprises for 1.850 million US dollars.


The three enterprises receiving indemnification are the Shanghai
Household Textile Import & Export Company, Shanghai Rongheng
International Trade Import & Export Company and the Jiaxing Tianfa
Silk Import & Export Company of Zhejiang Province.


The Shanghai Household Textile Import & Export Company established
trade relations with the Commercial Resources Company of New Mexico
of the US, beginning in 1993, and both parties agree to adopt the
bank trust method to pay and accept commercial notes, but, the First
National Bank of America has been privately and directly delivering
express mail sent from China (including commercial notes such as
bills of lading, etc.) to the CR Company free of charge. The CR
Company, after collecting goods with bills of lading, has been
delaying making payments or not paying and has defaulted on payments
reaching as high as 1.850 million US dollars as payment for goods.

In April of last year, the CR Company began bankruptcy procedures and
the debt compensation rate of all its assets was only 5%.


The Shanghai Rongheng International Trade Import & Export Company and
the Jiaxing Tianfa Silk Import & Export Company of Zhejiang Province
had situations similar to the above.

Therefore, the three companies engaged the Duan & Duan Law Firm and
authorized handling of such legal affairs as litigation and claims
for indemnification in the US, etc.

After a preparation period Qihua Duan, a lawyer living in America
with a Master's degree, and a local lawyer from New Mexico formally
submitted a plaint indicting the First National Bank to the US New
Mexico Federal District Court.


During the court trial, the opposing counsel actually denied facts
that the Chinese collecting bank's delivered collection documents.

At this, counsel Qihuan Duan and his colleagues again conducted
difficult investigations and evidence collections, and finally
obtained the express mail documents delivery numbers and the evidence
that First National Bank signed and received.


At the beginning of September of this year, the US Federal District
Court of New Mexico reached a verdict: in the claim lodged by the
plaintiff, the facts are clear and the evidence plentiful; the
defendant, the First National Bank had obviously violated Chapter
Four of the US Commercial Code of and Article No. 322 of the
International Chamber of Commerce. The court ruled that the bank
should take full liability for the amount of 31 collection notes from
the Shanghai Household Textile Import & Export Company compensating
1.850 million US dollars.

The two parties finally reached a settlement of 1.7 million US
dollars.


At the same time, the defendant also reached a mediated settlement
with the Shanghai Rongheng International Trade Import & Export
Company and the Jiaxing Tianfa Silk Import & Export Company of
Zhejiang Province for a claim sum of 155,000 US dollars.

Recently, the "Duan & Duan Law Firm" remitted the claims, totaling
1.850 million US dollars, to the three enterprises.


It was learned that the "Duan & Duan Law Firm" in Shanghai was
founded in 1993 by Qihua Duan, a lawyer who returned to China with a
US Master's degree.

In recent years, this law firm has internationally won more than ten
foreign-related economic cases, and has recovered claims of nearly 10
million US dollars for domestic enterprises and citizens.

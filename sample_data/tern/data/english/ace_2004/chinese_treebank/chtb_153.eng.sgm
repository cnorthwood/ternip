US capital corporations have become the corporations with the most
profits among Tianjin's foreign merchant investment corporations.


This was pointed out today by Tianjin's vice-Mayor, Disheng Ye, when
he made a thematic investment report for the '97 MBA class
international on-site observation group of the US New York University
Stone Business Administration Institute.


Disheng Ye presented that Tianjin has a population of 9.4 million and
is the biggest international harbor city and external trading shore
in northern China.

Tianjin's gross domestic product has continuously increased by more
than 14% for four years.

Currently, there are more than 10,000 foreign merchant investment
corporations in the entire city, and foreign capital of about 16
billion US dollars, among which US capital is ranked second.


Disheng Ye said, currently there are a total of 2,000 US capital
corporations in Tianjin with total investment values of 2 billion US
dollars.

merchant investment, with operating volume occupying 32%, but profits
occupying 45%.

Tianjin, and investment has already increased to 1.2 billion US
dollars in 1995.

At the same time, this company's operating volume increased from 50
million US dollars in past years to 2 billion US dollars last year,

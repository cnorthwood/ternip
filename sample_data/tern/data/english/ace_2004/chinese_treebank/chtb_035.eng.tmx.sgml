Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, <TIMEX2 val="1996-04-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">April 6th</TIMEX2>, by reporter Daojia Li

The economy and trade exchange between Tianjin, an important economic
city of north China, and the Russian Federation is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-04-06" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">currently</TIMEX2> steadily
developing, and has shown new features.


This reporter learned that, <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>, Tianjin's export trade volume
to Russia was 25 million US dollars, and import volume of more than
20 million US dollars with exports growing by more than 80 percent
since <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2>.

Aside from this, Tianjin has more than ten enterprises that have
established companies or representative offices in Russia; Russian
companies investing in Tianjin also have reached more than 20. The
amount of foreign investment from the other side is approximately 10
million US dollars.

The bilateral economy and trade relations are developing steadily.


According to general understanding, Tianjin and Russia are
interlinked with convenient express air, sea, and land ports, and
have historically had substantive barter trade and economic trade
co-operation.

In <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past two years</TIMEX2>, with the development and change in the economy
of the Russian Federation, general methods of bilateral trade have
already gradually replaced barter trade, and trading volume has
steadily increased.

At <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-04-06" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">present</TIMEX2>, Binhai International Airport in Tianjin has become the
largest airport in China for Community of Independent States
countries' air freighters in terms of the number of flights and the
amount of products transported for export from China. In <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the last
year</TIMEX2> alone, air freighter flights reached 4241, and total cargo
reached 42,000 tons.


Officials from Tianjin Foreign Economic and Trade Committee say that
Tianjin and Russia are geographically adjacent, and have a strong
trade complement.

As an important industrial city in northern China and a foreign trade
port with vast inland, Tianjin's light industry products, food
products and livestock products exported to Russia <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>
accounted for 50% of the amount of export from Tianjin to Russia;
whereas steel and non-ferrous metals imported from Russia accounted
for 60% of import volume from Russia.

As Russia's domestic need for industrial products develops towards
medium and advanced levels and its domestic economic situation
stabilizes, many Tianjin "triple-funded enterprises" are actively
seeking to enter the Russian market.

Since <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of last year</TIMEX2>, some large-scale professional foreign
trade companies started to send sales teams, exhibition sale
delegations, etc., to enter Russia to seek to expand business.


Relevant people who analyzed, believe that with the promotion of
economic and trade relations between the Chinese and Russian
governments, the prospects of trade, investment, labor service
exchange activities, etc., between Tianjin and the Russian
Commonwealth look good.

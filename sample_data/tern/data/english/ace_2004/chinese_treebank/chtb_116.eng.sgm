Nanchang accelerates construction of ports handling river cargo
</HEADLINE>

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 16th, by reporter Jing Lu

In Nanchang, another recently built international container terminal
was made available for operation recently, thereby further improving
conditions of the existing external passageway of Jiangxi, an inland
province.


Near the container dock which was built on Ganjiang port, units such
as Nanchang Customs, provincial sanitation inspection, commodity
inspection, animal and plant quarantine, etc. established the
"freight management area for the Nanchang port of the Nanchang
freight port".

The local officials said that, the previous situation whereby large
numbers of import and export goods of Jiangxi province had to be
re-shipped through the Guangzhou port and the Shanghai port in the
form of sparse packaging will be changed completely.


During the early days, a 5000 ton class container dock had already
been built in Jiujiang port in the north of Jiangxi. The Nanchang
port became another "access to the sea" in Jiangxi besides the
Jiujiang port.


According to presentations by responsible officials of this port, the
international container terminal of Jiujiang port to the north of
Jiangxi had an area of over 4700 square meters, and 128 standard
containers can be hoisted each day, with an annual handling capacity
of about 30,000.

It ended the history of Nanchang port no loading or unloading
international containers.


Persons concerned analyzed that, accelerating the construction of
ports handling river cargo was another symbol of the further
improvement of location advantages in Jiangxi province after the
Beijing-Kowloon railroad opened up to traffic.

The third main artery of China connecting the south and the north,
the Beijing-Kowloon railroad, was completed successfully in 1995.
Jiangxi, where one third of the route passes through, has become the
province that has benefited the most.


At present, five train lines namely the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, the
Yingtan-Xiamen, the Anhui-Jiangxi, the Beijing-Kowloon and the
Wuhan-Jiujiang, and eleven train lines crisscross across the
province. Nanchang has emerged from a closed land of the past to
become the new inland traffic center.

Constructing international container ports has become the inevitable
trend of economy development.


The media reported that, in the coastal region, the number of
international container docks in the three places namely Jiangsu,
Zhejiang and Shanghai alone, had already reached more than twenty.

Many inland provinces, including Jiangxi, are all further improving
investment conditions.

In the next two years, China will improve 2400 kilometers of inland
river routes and build more than 160 new berthing points, including
container docks.


Shengyou Shu, the governor of Jiangxi province, said, "In the
recently ended year of 1997, the total value of commodity exports was
1.6 billion US dollars, and every effort will be made to breakthrough
the figure of 1.8 billion US dollars this year".

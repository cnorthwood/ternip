Germany's Foreign Minister, Kinkerl said that, he welcomed the NATO
ultimatum to the Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

At <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="I thought this might mean 'also', but there's an 'also' in the sentence as well.">the same time</TIMEX2>, he also demanded that new talks be held to end the
civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.


Kinkerl said that NATO's decision was "correct and necessary".

But, as an auxiliary method of military measures, restarting a
dialogue is also necessary.

He requested the United Nations, the European Union, the US and
Russia to put forward a new joint proposal to force both warring
parties of the Bosnia-Herzegovina to return to the negotiating table.


On <TIMEX2 val="1994-04-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 22nd</TIMEX2>, the sixteen NATO countries asked the armed forces of the

humanitarian aid would go unblocked and unhindered, otherwise NATO
would begin air strikes against the Serbian army.

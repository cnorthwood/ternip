           ACE Time Normalization (TERN) 2004 English Training Data V1.0

                                 February 1, 2005

Introduction
------------

This release contains the English training data prepared for the
2004 Time Expression Recognition and Normalization (TERN) Evaluation, 
sponsored by the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program.  The evaluation 
was held in August 2004 and a workshop in September 2004. Evaluation 
participants received this data for training purposes, and it is now being 
released for general use. 

The annotation specifications for this corpus were developed under DARPA's 
Translingual Information Detection Extraction and Summarization (TIDES) 
program, with continuing support from ACE.

Corpus Applications
-------------------

Keywords:  temporal reasoning, information extraction,
     automatic content extraction, question answering, summarization

The purpose of this corpus and the TERN evaluation is to advance the
state of the art in the automatic recognition and normalization of 
natural language temporal expressions.  In most language contexts such 
expressions are indexical.  For example, with "Monday", "last week", or 
"three months starting October 1", one must know the narrative reference 
time in order to pinpoint the time interval being conveyed by the expression.
In addition, for data exchange purposes, it is essential that the identified
interval be rendered according to an established standard, i.e., normalized.
Accurate identification and normalization of temporal expressions is in turn 
essential for the temporal reasoning being demanded by advanced NLP 
applications such as question answering, information extraction, and 
summarization.

Data Profile
------------

All of the TERN data is text, and is grouped by individual directories 
according to each source type:

  bnews - Broadcast news data from the TDT-4 Corpus

  nwire - Newswire data from the TDT-4 Corpus

  npaper - Washington Post articles (ace_2002 only)

  arabic_treebank - Data from the Arabic Treebank 1 Corpus 
    English translations from the MT-2003 translation data set

  chinese_treebank - Data from the Chinese Treebank Version 4
   English translations from the Chinese Treebank English Parallel Text Corpus

This publication includes both the source data files in sgml format and the
annotated files, also in sgml format (*.tmx.sgml). 

An md5sum list is provided in each data directory for validation purposes.

Languages
---------

This release of the TERN data contains only English language files.  The 2004 
TERN evaluation also made use of Chinese language files, but these are not 
being released at this time, pending further quality control procedures. 

Corpus Structure and Size
-------------------------

The data/ directory contains the English corpus, which consists of
862 files (306K words) distributed in three directories:
ace_2002, ace_2003, and ace_2004.
  
The TIMEX2 annotation in the ace_2002 data set was originally created 
for the ACE 2002 Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC) evaluation.  
For this release, the annotations have been updated by two experienced 
annotators, compared, and then reconciled. It is further divided by source: 
broadcast news, newspaper, and newswire.  
The size of this set is as follows:

          words    documents
bnews     17,922   85
npaper    14,682   17
nwire     34,134   78                                  
TOTAL     66,738  180

The data in ace_2003 contains the training corpus files used in the ACE 2003 
evaluation. For this release, they have been doubly-annotated for TIMEX2 tags 
and reconciled.
The size of this set is as follows:

	 words    documents
bnews	 34,681   147
nwire	 58,592   102
TOTAL	 93,273   249

The data in ace_2004 contains four subdirectories:

The TDT-4 files selected by LDC for the ACE 2004 training data are contained 
in bnews/ and nwire/.  All of the files were doubly-annotated and reconciled.
The size of this set is as follows:

	 words    documents
bnews	 61,621	  222
nwire	 58,543   116
TOTAL   120,464	  338

The English translations of Arabic Treebank and Chinese Treebank files 
selected for ACE 2004 are contained in arabic_treebank/ and 
chinese_treebank/, respectively. These files have been singly-annotated 
and second-passed by a second annotator.
The size of this set is as follows:

		     words	documents
arabic_treebank	     13,466	58
chinese_treebank     12,522	37
TOTAL		     25,988	95


DTDs
----

The dtds/ directory contains two dtds.  Each dtd is based on 
LDC's srctext.dtd, available from LDC for use with their TDT4 data. 
It has been modified to accommodate files annotated with TIMEX2 and 
STORY_REF_TIME tags.

srctext_for_Timex2-2002.dtd is for use with ace_2002 files
srctext_for_Timex2.dtd is for use with ace_2003 and ace_2004
   bnews, nwire, and treebank files

NOTE: english/chinese_treebank/chtb_153.eng.* contain two ampersands,
which some sgml parsers (e.g., NSGMLS) may have difficulties with. 

DOC
---- 

In addition to this readme, the doc/ directory contains a copy of
the "TIDES 2003 Standard for the Annotation of Temporal Expressions,"
which are the annotation guidelines used to create this corpus. 

Bonus Tags
----------

The English ACE_2002 data contain an additional tag, STORY_REF_TIME,
which users might find useful in training their systems. This tag
was originally added as a training aid for the 2002 ACE RDC evaluation 
participants.  It was NOT a required output for the system.

The STORY_REF_TIME is the typical reference time used by the
writer/speaker of a given article, and is useful for computing 
values for indexical expressions (today, yesterday, next Tuesday, 
two weeks ago...).   Be warned that the reference time can shift 
throughout an article; the STORY_REF_TIME tag is intended only as a 
general guide.

 Finally today, we learned that the space agency  has  finally taken a giant
 leap forward. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Eileen Collins  will  be named
 commander of the Space Shuttle Columbia for a mission in December. Colonel
 Collins has been the co-pilot before, but this time she's the boss. Here's
 ABC's Ned Potter.


 Even two hundred miles up in space, there has been a glass ceiling. It wasn't
 until
 twenty years after the first astronauts  were chosen that NASA finally included
 six women, and they were all scientists, not pilots. No woman has actually
 been in charge of a mission until now.


 Just the fact that we 're doing the job that we 're doing makes us role
 models.


 That was Eileen Collins, after she flew as the first ever co-pilot. Being
 commander is different. It means supervising the rest of the crew in
 training and leading them in flight. It is, in short, the kind of
 management job many American women say they've had to fight for. In space,
 some say female pilots  were held up until now by the lack of piloting
 opportunities for them in the military.


 Once Colonel Collins  was picked as a NASA astronaut, she followed a
 normal progression within NASA. Nobody hurried her up. No one held her
 back.


 Many NASA watchers say female astronauts  have become part of the agency's
 routine. But they still have catching up to do two hundred and thirty four Americans  have flown in space, only twenty six of them women. Ned Potter, ABC News.

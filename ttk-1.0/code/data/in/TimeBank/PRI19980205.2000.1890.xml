 The US is bolstering its military presence in the gulf,
 as President Clinton discussed the Iraq crisis with the one
 ally who has backed his threat of force, British prime
 minister Tony Blair.
 The World's Nancy Marshall reports on Mr. Blair's current
 visit to Washington and the special relationship between the
 two leaders.


 President Clinton rolled out the red carpet for prime
 minister Blair, welcoming him not only as a close ally, but a
 close friend.
 Posing for photographers with Clinton, Blair pledged to stand
 united with the president against Iraq, warning Saddam Hussein
 that the threat of force is real.
 The British aircraft carrier invincible is now patrolling the
 Persian Gulf alongside three US vessels.
 Washington and London are virtually alone in warning Iraq of
 military strikes if it does n't back down on the weapons
 inspection issue.
 President Clinton says he and Blair will stand together not just on Iraq but also on arresting the terrorists suspected of
 blowing up Pan Am flight one oh three over Scotland.
 For The World I'm Nancy Marshall in Washington.

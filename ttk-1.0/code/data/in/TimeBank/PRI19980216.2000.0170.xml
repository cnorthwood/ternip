 The British government  has  formally called for Sinn Fein, the IRA's
 political wing,  to  be expelled from the multiparty peace talks on northern
 Ireland. The move  had  been widely expected after northern Ireland police
 said they believe the IRA was behind two killings in Belfast last week. Sinn
 Fein chairman Mitchell McLaughlin says the party  will challenge the move by
 legal means if they have to.


 We 're going  to fight it. And uh we 've  already challenged , very strongly, the uh the terms
 in which this  has  been presented. But we 're challenging it on the ground that uh
 the RUC uh  have offered an opinion, and this opinion  is going  to  be used as a mechanism for ejecting us from the talks, and uh that's a very
 serious.


 Any decision  to expel Sinn Fein must  be agreed jointly by the governments
 of both Britain and the Irish Republic.

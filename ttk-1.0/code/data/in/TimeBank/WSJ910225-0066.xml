   WASHINGTON -- With the ground battle to liberate Kuwait
proceeding with surprising speed and success, Bush
administration officials are optimistic the Persian Gulf war
can begin winding down in a matter of days.
   The enormous ground offensive by U.S. Marines and Army
troops, at least during its first 24 hours, met only sporadic
Iraqi resistance as it quickly penetrated deep into Kuwait
and parts of Iraq, military officials said. According to
press pool reports, U.S. Marines are already on the outskirts
of Kuwait City.

   "So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic
success," said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander
of U.S. forces. Similarly, while cautioning about the
uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said late yesterday that "the operation has been very successful." Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi
soldiers had surrendered, administration aides were also
upbeat in private, with one even talking of victory within a
week.
   But even continued military success carries political and
diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S. The allied
rejection of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort to avoid the ground war enabled Mr. Bush to seize the initiative
from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating peace terms. But it
has offended some, especially in Arab countries, who now believe that Mr. Bush's real objectives are the demise of
Saddam Hussein and the destruction of the Iraqi military, not
just the liberation of Kuwait.
   "Why have a war?" asked Abdul Latif Shekar, a customs
officer in Egypt, a country participating in the attack on
Iraqi troops. "I think the Gorbachev plan was a good one.
Iraq was ready to withdraw." Now, he says, "it looks like the
West just wants to destroy Iraq."
   Despite the early indications of success, the allied
forces could still suffer greater casualties and become
bogged down militarily  , especially when they encounter the
tough Republican Guard, which is entrenched along the
Iraq-Kuwait border. If so, and if it appears that the
American goal actually is to destroy the Iraqi regime even at
the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, "the lingering cost
of that could be high," worries former national security
adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. But, he notes, "If everything
crumbles totally, that won't be such a problem."
   American officials staunchly disavow any interest in
driving through Iraq toward Baghdad, either in pursuit of
Saddam Hussein himself or to set up some American-controlled
government inside Iraq. The Americans say their battle plans
call for operating against forces inside Iraq as far north as
the city of Basra, about 30 miles north of Kuwait, but say
there is n't  any plan to drive beyond that.
   Indeed, French President Francois Mitterrand said
yesterday that some allied forces are crossing Iraqi
territory as part of a "pincer" movement to trap the soldiers
occupying Kuwait, but insisted, "The purpose isn't to invade
Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate."
   Nevertheless, American officials over the weekend became
more open in declaring that by destroying Saddam Hussein's
military machine they hope to destroy his regime -- a goal
likely to be supported by most Americans.
   In a pre-attack message, Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, the top
Marine in the Persian Gulf, told U.S. Marines that their goal
is to " restore {Kuwait} to its citizens." He went on to add
that "in so doing you not only return a nation to its people,
but you will destroy the war machine of a ruthless dictator."
   Secretary of State James Baker said on ABC-TV's "This Week
With David Brinkley" that the series of United Nations
resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait "imply that
the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a
heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not  in
power in Iraq."
   Of course, it is still far too early to assume that the
military situation on the ground will stay as smooth for
allied forces as it appears to have been so far. Iraq still
has the potential to cause significant problems by using
forces and weapons that don't yet seem fully engaged.
   For one thing, Iraq still apparently has n't unleashed its
stockpile of chemical weapons. Gen. Schwarzkopf said that
some early reports that chemical weapons were used against
allied troops turned out to be "bogus." Iraq is believed to have the ability to deliver chemical weapons in artillery
shells or, perhaps, atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles.
   Perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops
have n't yet fully engaged Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard,
which has been sitting just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border
and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi
defense. It remains to be seen how much damage the allied air
campaign was able to inflict on the Guard, and whether
President Hussein will commit his most valued troops to a
fight-to-the-death finish.
   Certainly Saddam Hussein continues to implore his country
to fight on. "Fight them," he urged Iraqis in a radio
address. "All Iraqis, fight them with all the power you have,
and all struggle for everything."
   American war planners have long assumed that the early
stage of the ground attack, in which American forces would use their speed to sweep around Iraqi defenses and their
strength to punch through the relatively weak Iraqi front
line, would be the easiest part.
   Despite these early successes, the mere fact that a ground
campaign has begun almost guarantees that the Bush
administration will face fresh problems growing out of the
military situation. There are likely to be additional
American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that
President Hussein is taking Kuwaiti hostages. U.S. and
Kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of
civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded up and held by
Iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or
for use later in bargaining once the war is over.
   President Bush's political argument for going to a ground
war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of
wanton Iraqi destruction inside Kuwait. U.S. officials say
that hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells now may have been set afire. And Robert Gates, Mr. Bush's deputy national security
adviser, asserted in an interview on the Cable News Network
that Iraqi troops have set fire to "large sections" of Kuwait
City.
   Mr. Bush and his aides were leaning toward a military
conclusion of the crisis even before the latest reports of
Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait came to light. The president and
his top aides tentatively decided on Feb. 11 that a ground
war would be necessary. The decision was made after Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned from a visit with military
commanders in Saudi Arabia, administration officials say.
Then, a week or so ago, Gen. Schwarzkopf secretly picked
Saturday night as the optimal time to start the offensive.
   The date was unaffected by the last-ditch Soviet peace
initiative. The real problem with the Soviet proposals, U.S.
officials now say, was that they all would have required
lifting economic sanctions against Iraq. The Bush
administration considers the sanctions essential to keeping
Saddam Hussein under control should he survive the war.
   Mr. Bush forestalled further diplomatic maneuvering by
issuing an ultimatum on behalf of the allies demanding that
Iraq withdraw within a week, starting at noon Saturday.
Administration aides said that the idea of the ultimatum was
Gen. Powell's. He argued setting an explicit deadline for
Saddam Hussein to break would, when it was broken, give the
U.S. military a clear green light to proceed.
   In setting out his final challenge to Saddam Hussein, Mr.
Bush continued the intensive personal diplomacy he began
after the invasion llast August. After cabling world leaders
about his intention to give Saddam Hussein a final deadline
to exit Kuwait, he offered him a week to withdraw fully  , instead of the four days he originally considered, because of
objections from some European partners that four days seemed
punitive and unrealistic.
   And when he and President Gorbachev spoke about the
decision in a talk lasting nearly an hour, the President took
pains to listen to what his counterpart had to say, although
he already had decided that the Soviet alternative to the
allied deadline was unacceptable.
   Finally, when Iraq failed to respond to the U.S.
ultimatum, Mr. Bush let the ground offensive begin as
previously planned Saturday night.
   The attack was lightning quick, as allied forces punched
through tall sand berms on the border and pushed forward into
Iraq and Kuwait. U.S. Marines were said to have breached
troublesome mine fields along the Iraqi lines but Pentagon
officials said no amphibious assault on Kuwait's beaches had begun. Long columns of Iraqi prisoners of war could be seen
trudging through the desert toward the allied rear. U.S.
commanders said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken in the first
hours of the ground war, though some military officials later said the total may have climbed above 8,000.
   The U.S. hopes its troops will drive Iraqi forces out of
Kuwait quickly , leaving much of Iraq's offensive military
equipment destroyed or abandoned in Kuwait. It expects that
tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers will surrender to the
U.S. and its allies over the the next few days.
   If the allies succeed, Saddam Hussein will have plunged
his country first into a fruitless eight-year-long war
against Iran and then into a humiliating war against the U.S.
and the allies to defend his conquest of Kuwait, leaving much
of his country's military establishment and modern
infrastructure in ruins.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. hopes, economic sanctions and an
international arms embargo will remain in effect until Iraq
pays war reparations to Kuwait to cover war damages. That
would undermine any chances of rebuilding either Iraq or its
armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein remains
in power. The American hope is that someone from within Iraq,
perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward
and push Saddam Hussein aside so that the country can begin
recovering from the disaster.
   Outside analysts think Saddam Hussein's position is indeed
precarious. "I think frankly Saddam is finished, no matter
what happens," says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar
who has written extensively about Iraq. "These guys simply do n't retire to condos over the Euphrates."
   Despite the lack of any obvious successors, the Iraqi
leader's internal power base appeared to be narrowing even
before the war began. Some analysts say he appeared to be relying on a smaller and smaller circle of close advisers and
relatives. If that's true, the narrowing of his support would make it easier for someone to push him aside from within.
   Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein's support within the
Iraqi military. And the U.S. now will face sharper questions
in the Arab world since it did n't  back  the peace proposals
worked out in Moscow. "We looked to the United States, we
expected you to have the moral edge," says Nasser Tahboub, a
Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has an American wife and a
doctorate in political science from Duke University. "Now we
see that edge eroded. For me, it is a great tragedy. For the
first time in history, the U.S. has gone to war with an Arab
and Muslim nation, and we know a peaceful solution was in
reach."

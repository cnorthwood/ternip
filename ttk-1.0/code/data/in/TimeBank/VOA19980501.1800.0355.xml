 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says considerable gaps remain
 between Israeli and Palestinian positions before next week's talks in
 London. He and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat meet separately Monday with
 US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
 At a news conference with US Vice President Al Gore in Jerusalem, Mr.
 Netanyahu suggested Israel might be willing to move a little on issues
 holding up peace, but he said he expects an equal effort from the
 Palestinians.


 If Israel  is asked to uh stretch itself on matters that are vital to its
 security concerns, then we must see an equal effort on the other side.


 Mr. Gore called on Israel  to continue taking risks for peace.

On
the
other
hand
,
it
's
turning
out
to
be
another
very
bad
financial
week
for
Asia
.
<s>
The
financial
assistance
from
the
World
Bank
and
the
International
Monetary
Fund
are
not
helping
.
<s>
In
the
last
twenty
four
hours
,
the
value
of
the
Indonesian
stock
market
has
fallen
by
twelve
percent
.
<s>
The
Indonesian
currency
has
lost
twenty
six
percent
of
its
value
.
<s>
In
Singapore
,
stocks
hit
a
five
year
low
.
<s>
In
the
Philippines
,
a
four
year
low
.
<s>
And
in
Hong
Kong
,
a
three
percent
drop
.
<s>
More
problems
in
Hong
Kong
for
a
place
,
for
an
economy
,
that
many
experts
thought
was
once
invincible
.
<s>
Here
's
ABC
's
Jim
Laurie
.
<s>
Not
that
long
ago
,
before
the
Chinese
takeover
,
the
news
about
real
estate
here
was
that
the
sky
was
the
limit
the
highest
prices
in
the
world
.
<s>
So
when
Wong
Kwan
spent
seventy
million
dollars
for
this
house
,
he
thought
it
was
a
great
deal
.
<s>
He
sold
the
property
to
five
buyers
and
said
he
'd
double
his
money
.
<s>
In
Hong
Kong
,
is
always
belongs
to
the
seller
's
market
.
<s>
Now
with
new
construction
under
way
,
three
of
his
buyers
have
backed
out
.
<s>
And
Wong
Kwan
will
be
lucky
to
break
even
.
<s>
All
across
Hong
Kong
,
the
property
market
has
crashed
.
<s>
Pamela
Pak
owns
eight
condominiums
here
.
<s>
Pak
ca
n
't
find
buyers
.
<s>
She
estimates
her
properties
,
worth
a
hundred
thirty
million
dollars
in
October
,
are
worth
only
half
that
now
.
<s>
They
believe
ah
it
will
be
always
up
going
up
and
up
ah
forever
.
<s>
Nobody
believe
this
any
more
.
<s>
Of
all
of
Asia
's
economies
,
Hong
Kong
is
the
most
robust
.
<s>
But
in
the
past
three
months
,
stocks
have
plunged
,
interest
rates
have
soared
and
the
downturn
all
across
Asia
means
that
people
are
not
spending
here
.
<s>
Hotels
are
only
thirty
percent
full
.
<s>
You
can
get
seventy
percent
discounts
at
the
shopping
malls
.
<s>
Three
thousand
dollar
pearls
for
eight
hundred
dollars
.
<s>
A
two
hundred
dollar
wool
jacket
for
fifty
dollars
.
<s>
Still
,
there
are
few
buyers
.
<s>
And
at
the
big
brokerage
houses
,
after
ten
years
of
boom
,
they
're
talking
about
layoffs
.
<s>
I
think
that
the
mood
is
fairly
gloomy
,
and
I
think
it
's
not
going
to
change
for
a
couple
of
years
.
<s>
So
for
Hong
Kong
,
it
's
time
,
as
investment
bankers
like
to
say
,
to
reposition
.
<s>
To
either
hold
on
tight
or
get
out
,
as
much
of
Asia
goes
into
recession
.

<TEXT>
<s>TECHNOETHICS, or the written and unwritten codes of practice in
dealing with technology, is becoming imperative as we move towards
the Information age.</s>
<s>This is because the rapid development of technology is not only affecting changes in human thought and behaviour, but also stirring up new ethical issues and moral dilemmas.</s>
<s>The human culture is growing more mechanised.</s> <s>We wake up , eat,
work and sleep according to the dictates of the machines that are supposed to make our lives easier than those of our grandparents'.</s>
<s>Computer chips have been <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE" >incorporated</EVENT> into everyday objects ever
since the <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE" >introduction</EVENT> of integrated circuits in the <TIMEX3 mod="APPROX" tid="t293" type="DURATION" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" value="1950" >late 1950s</TIMEX3>.</s>
<s>It has been <EVENT eid="e29" class="REPORTING" >said</EVENT> that<TIMEX3 tid="t294" type="DATE" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" value="1998-05-26" anchorTimeID="t292" > today</TIMEX3>, an average home <SIGNAL sid="s31" >might</SIGNAL> <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE" >have</EVENT> <CARDINAL>40</CARDINAL> chips
in different appliances, from washing machines to television sets
to alarm clocks.</s>

<EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE" >help</EVENT> of the good old computer!</s> <s>In view of the growing dominance of
technology, the 20th century man has been considered as a
``sorcerer's apprentice'' who is becoming a slave of his erstwhile
servant.</s>
<s>This is the opinion of a lobby of intellectuals who feel
uncomfortable about the growing impact of modern technology on our
life.</s>
<s>They suggest that technological progress is getting out of hand,
and developing according to its own immanent laws.</s>
<s>It seems that machines, for example, are reshaping man to their
own images of stiffness, exactness and ``soullessness''.</s>
<s>According to them, technology has become ``natural'' to man so
much so that he can be referred to as techno, rather than homo
sapiens.</s>
<s>However, the other school of thought argues that the perspective
which personifies technology as an autonomous agent with
mythological properties, is a creation of humanists who have very
little insight into the structures of the technological order.</s>
<s>Technology in the broad sense of the word is one of the most
fundamental characteristics which define man within the family of
living beings.</s>
<s>Unlike animals which are defined by the harmonious way their
organs and functions are related to the environment, man largely
lacks such a grandiose tie.</s>
<s>His survival cannot depend on instinctive reactions only.</s> <s>He has
to learn to react and deal with new situations all the time.</s>
<s>And he can  successfully do this by creating an artificial
environment for himself, thus allowing the technological milieu to survive.</s>
<s>In fact, with technology, man is in a position to provide a
decent living condition for many, if not all, life forms on earth.</s>
<s>It cannot be denied that technology also provides the platform
for man to destroy his living environment in an irreversible way,
and maybe all life on our planet.</s>
<s>The <TIMEX3 mod="ON_OR_BEFORE" tid="t295" type="DATE" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" value="1998-05-26" >recent</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e296" class="OCCURRENCE" >intransigence</EVENT> of a south Asian nation <SIGNAL sid="s101" >in</SIGNAL> <EVENT eid="e102" class="OCCURRENCE" >flexing</EVENT> its
nuclear muscle is a case in point.</s>
<s>Nevertheless, as has been repeatedly stressed, technology is a
mere tool.</s> <s>It is neutral and has no internal criterion of
self-regulation.</s>
<s>Technology also does not exist in a vacuum but within the
context of a given culture with beliefs and accepted values,
presumably based on religious prescriptions.</s>
<s>The ability to make decisions pertaining to the use of
technology by referring to the religious criteria is what
technoethics is all about.</s>
<s>One of the most prominent aspects of info technology is the
global communications network, represented by the Internet.</s>
<s>Besides information, person-to-person communication in the form
of electronic mailing systems and chat groups are also available.</s>
<s>With its wide-reaching capability, the Internet is not only used
to retrieve information, but also to add information to the world
communications network.</s>
<s>One can find in it a plethora of input and experiences from
thousands of people of various cultures, creeds and religions.</s>
<s>The Internet caters to <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> groups of users, the information
providers and information consumers.</s>
<s>Thus, technoethics of the Internet, commonly referred to as
netiquette, has to be looked at from the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> perspectives
separately.</s>
<s>As information providers, users need to be responsible in
disseminating the truth.</s> <s>This is evidently lacking in the global
communications network.</s>
<s>There are huge numbers of websites propagating immoral
activities, lies and character assassinations.</s>
<s>As a result, all kinds of scandals and slanders are circulating
in cyberspace.</s>
<s>Electronic poison letters are also rampant, despite some of the
writers and senders themselves claiming to be deeply religious.</s>
<s>Even the use of abusive language is justified on the basis of
defending their religious convictions.</s>
<s>The freedom of expression is sometimes taken to such an extent
so as to invade other people's privacy.</s>
<s>How many times have you found unsolicited electronic mail
forwarded to you by those who do not have the guts to reveal his or
her real identity?</s>
<s>To these phantom providers, please have a thought for
technoethics.</s>
<s>Frankly, without a proper perspective on the good and bad sides
of the global communications network, information consumers are at
the mercy of unscrupulous providers.</s>
<s>The lure of on-line pornography is tremendous.</s> <s>Many spend hours
daily surfing the Internet for erotic pictures and stories without
realising that they are wasting their time and money.</s>
<s>The worst part is that sometimes it is not  of their own but,
rather, their department's or company's.</s>
<s>As for children, a new sordid phenomenon is unfolding on the
Internet, via the chat rooms.</s>
<s>It has been <EVENT eid="e194" class="REPORTING" >reported</EVENT> <TIMEX3 mod="ON_OR_BEFORE" tid="t298" type="TIME" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" value="PRESENT_REF" >recently</TIMEX3> that cyber-paedophiles and
child-molesters are <EVENT eid="e195" class="OCCURRENCE" >prowling</EVENT> these discussion groups.</s>
<s>They <SIGNAL sid="s197" >would</SIGNAL> `` <EVENT eid="e196" class="OCCURRENCE" >insert</EVENT>'' themselves into the groups by <EVENT eid="e198" class="OCCURRENCE" >furnishing</EVENT> a

<SIGNAL sid="s203" >in</SIGNAL> sexually explicit <EVENT eid="e202" class="OCCURRENCE" >discussions</EVENT>.</s>
<s>So parents, beware!</s> <s>Do not think that once you leave your
children in front of the computer terminal, they are safe from
corrupt external influences.</s>
<s>The virtual prowlers can get into their bedrooms.</s> <s>The jungle is not  necessarily out  there anymore.</s> <s>Now it is right in our homes.</s>
<s>There is also no substitute for taking good care of your young
ones.</s>
<s>Guidance and supervision are still indispensable parts of proper
child-upbringing.</s> <s>Try to inculcate technoethics into them.</s> <s>The best
form of technoethics is one based on a strong faith in religion.</s>
<s><TIMEX3 tid="t301" type="DATE" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" value="PAST_REF" >Decades ago</TIMEX3>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">German philospher Martin Heidegger</ENAMEX> <EVENT eid="e222" class="OCCURRENCE" >wrote</EVENT> a
letter to his Japanese friend which was <EVENT eid="e224" class="OCCURRENCE" >reproduced</EVENT> in the Yomiuri
newspaper.</s>
<s>In it he expressed his concern that none of <TIMEX3 tid="t1953" type="DATE" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" value="PAST_REF" >today</TIMEX3>'s cultural
traditions possesses the means <SIGNAL sid="s229" >to</SIGNAL> cope effectively with the
challenges posed by expanding modern technology.</s>
<s>It does not matter whether you are living in a western,
modernised society or eastern, developing society.</s>
<s>There is simply no culture suited to tackle the technological
onslaught.</s>
<s>What we <SIGNAL sid="s243" ><SIGNAL sid="s1954" >can</SIGNAL></SIGNAL>  <EVENT eid="e244" class="OCCURRENCE" >do</EVENT> is <SIGNAL sid="s245" >to</SIGNAL> responsibly <EVENT eid="e246" class="OCCURRENCE" >monitor</EVENT> what is <EVENT eid="e1955" class="OCCURRENCE" >taking place</EVENT> in
present-day society, and <EVENT eid="e248" class="OCCURRENCE" >interpret</EVENT> it <SIGNAL sid="s249" >in</SIGNAL> the light of our religious
and cultural traditions.</s>
<s>For a Muslim, this implies the willingness to internalise the
Quranic messages that man has been created not to indulge in vain
desires.</s>
<s>He is a representative of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allah</ENAMEX> on earth and is ultimately
responsible for any form of destruction - physical or moral.</s>

<h2>1 &nbsp; Introduction</h2>

<p>This document represents the current specification of TimeML. This revision
  specifies the syntax of TimeML, i.e. essentially its tags and their attributes,
  with examples illustrating their basic use. Since the pure syntax of TimeML
  will often leave open how a particular phenomenon should be annotated (e.g.
  should modals in English be marked up as SIGNALs or EVENTs), this document
  leaves a number of issues underspecified. Fuller discussion of the conventions
  by which TimeML should be applied can be found in the accompanying annotation
  guidelines (Pustejovsky, et al. (2002)). </p>
<p>The document begins with the &quot;leaf nodes&quot; of TimeML: the tags that
  include texts (in most cases) that describe the basic temporal elements within
  a document. The next section introduces SIGNAL, the tag that wraps expressions
  that specify how temporal elements should be related. The third section deals
  with links, empty tags that explicitly annotate the temporal relations either
  marked by signals or indicated purely syntactically, The next section deals
  with miscellaneous other tags. The last section deals with open questions. </p>
<h4><b>Naming Conventions</b></h4>
<p>Inasmuch as XML is case-sensitive, it is necessary for TimeML to specify
  exactly the case of all its elements. This document follows the convention
  of indicating tag names and attribute values in all upper case (e.g. EVENT,
  PROGRESSIVE) and attribute names in lower or mixed case (e.g. tense, relatedToTime).
  Since attribute values are typically atomic (one-word) while attribute names
  often consist of multiple words, this convention would seem to maximize readability
  of the annotation. (Multi-word attribute values use the underscore character
  to separate their component parts.) </p>
<p>This document also follows the attribute naming convention introduced in
  Setzer (2001). Attributes that range over values of XML datatype ID---a unique
  index---are short, consisting of one or two characters indicating the name
  of the element, followed by 'id' (e.g. tid, eiid). Attributes that range over
  values of XML datatype IDREF---references to IDs---typically consist of the
  name of the element indexed, followed by 'ID' (e.g. eventID) or a descriptive
  name (e.g. relatedToTime). </p>
<p>The values of the various ID attributes are specified as beginning with one
  or two characters, followed by an integer. This scheme is mandated by the syntax
  of XML. While attribute values of type ID can consist of any sequence of letters,
  digits, and the hyphen, underscore, and period characters, they must begin
  with either an underscore or a letter. Therefore <tt>&quot;e23&quot;</tt> is
  a valid XML ID; but <tt>&quot;23&quot;</tt> is not. This naming convention
  also helps make the examples a bit more readable, especially in the case of
  link tags, which can contain multiple IDREFs of different kinds. </p>
<p>Finally, in the descriptions of the values of attributes, where XML DTD and
  XML schema definitions would differ, the schema definition is indicated between
  {}. </p>
<h4 >The Examples</h4>
<p>Though this document describes the full TimeML language, many of the example
  annotations provided show the result of annotation only through the output
  of initial automatic tagging combined with human annotation/editing, but do
  not include elements (e.g. attributes and/or attribute values) that may be
  introduced by later processing components (e.g. the closure tool). In particular,
  TIMEX3 tags that are treated as temporal functions typically appear in the
  examples in an underspecified form. However, those elements that do appear
  are sufficient for the output of manual annotation. </p>
<p>Finally, note that all examples in this document have been validated against
  a TimeML DTD corresponding to the BNF given here, using the oXygen XML editor,
  version 1.1. </p>

<p><a name="timemltags"></a></p>
<h2>2 &nbsp; TimeML Tags </h2>

<p><a name="event"></a></p>
<h3>2.1 &nbsp; &lt;EVENT&gt;</h3>

<p>The EVENT tag is used to annotate those elements in a text that mark the
  semantic events described by it. Syntactically, EVENTs are typically verbs,
  although event nominals, such as &quot;crash&quot; in &quot;...killed by the
  crash&quot;, will also be annotated as EVENTs. </p>
<p>The EVENT tag is also used to annotate a subset of the states in a document.
  This subset of states includes those that are either transient or explicitly
  marked as participating in a temporal relation. See the TimeML annotation guidelines
  for more details. </p>

<pre class="dtd">
attributes ::= eid class [comment]

eid ::= ID
{eid ::= EventID
EventID ::= e&lt;integer&gt;}
class ::= 'OCCURRENCE' | 'PERCEPTION' | 'REPORTING' | 'ASPECTUAL' |
          'STATE' | 'I_STATE' | 'I_ACTION'
comment ::= CDATA</pre>

Note: The <tt>comment</tt> attribute is a part of all the TimeML tags, and exists for annotators
to add clarifications and other observations about the text being marked.

<p><a name="makeinstance"></a></p>
<h3>2.1 &nbsp; &lt;MAKEINSTANCE&gt;</h3>

<p>MAKEINSTANCE is a realization link; it indicates different instances of a
  given event. Since different instances can have different attribute values,
  the tense and aspect of the event are represented within this tag. In addition,
  if the instance is modified by a negation or modal operator, this is represented
  in the appropriate attributes within this tag.&nbsp; One can create as many
  instances as are motivated by the text. All relations indicated by the other
  links are stated over these instances. Because of this, every EVENT introduces
  at least one corresponding MAKEINSTANCE. </p>

<pre class="dtd">
attributes ::= eiid eventID signalID pos tense aspect [cardinality] polarity
                [modality] [comment]

eiid ::= ID
{eiid ::= EventInstanceID
EventInstanceID ::= ei&lt;integer&gt;}
eventID ::= IDREF
{eventID ::= EventID}
signalID ::= IDREF
{signalID ::= SignalID}
pos ::= 'ADJECTIVE' | 'NOUN' | 'VERB' | 'PREPOSITION' | 'OTHER'
tense ::= 'FUTURE' | 'INFINITIVE' | 'PAST' | 'PASTPART' | 'PRESENT' | 'PRESPART' | 'NONE'
aspect ::= 'PROGRESSIVE' | 'PERFECTIVE' | 'PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE' | 'NONE'
cardinality ::= CDATA
polarity ::= 'NEG' | 'POS' {default, if absent, is 'POS'}
modality ::= CDATA
comment ::= CDATA
</pre>

<p>A MAKEINSTANCE can be considered to be a functional object that takes an <tt>EventID</tt> as
  its input and produces an <tt>EventInstanceID</tt> as its output. </p>
<p>We expect that the <tt>tense</tt> and <tt>aspect</tt> attributes will have
  their values filled in by a pre-processing program, according to the following
  paradigm: </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The <tt>pos</tt> ('part of speech') attribute captures distinctions among the grammatical
  categories of phrases which are marked as events, as not all such phrases contain finite
  verbs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><tt>signalID</tt> indicates a SIGNAL that either motivates the existence
  of the MAKEINSTANCE, or which indicates the value of the <tt>cardinality</tt> attribute
  (see annotation of &quot;John taught twice on Monday but only once on Tuesday&quot; below
  for an example of this). </p>
<p>The possible value of <tt>cardinality</tt> is given as CDATA, i.e. any ASCII
  text. In reality, its values are most likely to range over the integers, along
  with a limited number of quantificational elements such as &quot;EVERY&quot;, &quot;MOST&quot;,
  etc. It may be possible to create a more constraining datatype (e.g. &quot;Cardinality&quot;),
  based on the <tt>string</tt> datatype, which constrains it to a fixed set of
  word tokens, and any sequence of digits, but we have not yet done this. </p>
<p>The values of <tt>polarity</tt> and <tt>modality</tt> are determined by modifiers
  found near the event in the text. Formally, this information was annotated
  using a SIGNAL and a SLINK. Some examples:</p>

<pre>(1) should have bought

should have
&lt;EVENT eid=&quot;e1&quot; class=&quot;OCCURRENCE&quot;&gt;
bought
&lt;/EVENT&gt;
&lt;MAKEINSTANCE eiid=&quot;ei1&quot; eventID=&quot;e1&quot; pos=&quot;VERB&quot; tense=&quot;PAST&quot; aspect=&quot;PERFECTIVE&quot; modality=&quot;SHOULD&quot; polarity=&quot;POS&quot;/&gt;

&lt;EVENT eid=&quot;e1&quot; class=&quot;OCCURRENCE&quot;&gt;

&lt;MAKEINSTANCE eiid=&quot;ei1&quot; eventID=&quot;e1&quot; pos=&quot;VERB&quot; tense=&quot;PRESENT&quot; aspect=&quot;NONE&quot; polarity=&quot;NEG&quot;/&gt;

<h3>2.3 &nbsp; &lt;TIMEX3&gt;</h3>

<p>The TIMEX3 tag is primarily used to mark up explicit temporal expressions,
  such as times, dates, durations, etc. It is modeled on Setzer's (2001) TIMEX
  tag, as well as the TIDES (Ferro, et al. (2002)) TIMEX2 tag. Since it differs
  both in attribute structure and in use, it seemed best to give it a separate
  name, which reveals its heritage while at the same time indicating that it
  is different from its forebears. </p>

<p><tt>functionInDocument</tt>, an optional attribute, indicates the function
  of the TIMEX3 in providing a temporal anchor for other temporal expressions
  in the document. If this attribute is not explicitly supplied, the default
  value is &quot;NONE&quot;. The non-empty values take their names from the temporal
  metadata tags in the Prism draft standard (available at <u>http://www.prismstandard.org/techdev/prismspec1.asp</u>),
  and are intended to have the same interpretations:</p>
<p>There are several times that mark the major milestones in the life of a news
  resource: The time the story is published, the time it may be released (if
  not immediately), the time it is received by a customer, and the time that
  the story expires (if any). Dates and times should be represented using the
  W3C-defined profile of ISO 8601 [W3C-NOTE-datetime]</p>

<p>Note that there can be as many instances of TIMEX3s containing
  a <tt>functionInDocument</tt> attribute with a non-empty value as there are
  TIMEX3s that express different functions. In practice, there will probably
  be no more than two, one with CREATION_TIME and another with PUBLICATION_TIME,
  since these are likely to be the only attributes that will appear in the text
  of documents to be annotated. Note that RELEASE_TIME does not indicate when
  the document was actually released. It is a specification of when the document
  is allowed to be released. This comes up in documents that are syndicated and
  where the issuing organization wants to delay publication by syndicators, so
as not to be scooped.</p>
<p>Note also that the Prism standard, at least in its temporal indicators, is
  interested only in the document as an artifact, a piece of intellectual property.
  This means that the Prism values do not indicate the function of a TIMEX3 relative
  to the internal narrative of the document. The specification of the TimeML
  language can fill this gap by adding values for the <tt>functionInDocument</tt> attribute
  that capture narrative functions. At present, we leave the specification of
  possible values as is, and will defer the obvious extension until annotation
  of existing texts indicates that this is a pressing issue. </p>
<p><tt>temporalFunction</tt>, an optional attribute, indicates whether the TIMEX3
  is used as a temporal function; e.g. &quot;two weeks ago&quot;. If this attribute
  is not explicitly supplied, the default value is &quot;false&quot;. It is used
  in conjunction with <tt>anchorTimeID</tt>, which indicates the TIMEX3 to which
  its denotation is applied. It also appears with <tt>valueFromFunction</tt>,
  a pointer to a temporal function that determines its value. As was noted above,
  TIMEX3 tags that behave as temporal functions are often underspecified in the
  example annotations below. </p>
<p>The datatypes specified for the <tt>value</tt> attribute---Duration, Date,
  Time, WeekDate,&nbsp; WeekTime, Season, PartOfYear, PaPrFu---are XML datatypes
  based on the 2002 TIDES guideline, which extends the ISO 8601 standard for
  representing dates, times, and durations. See the 2002 TIDES guidelines for
  details about the value attribute, and see the TimeML Schema (www.timeml.org/timeMLdocs/TimeML.xsd)
  for complete definitions of each of these datatypes.</p>
<p><tt>mod</tt> is an optional attribute adopted from TIDES. It is used for
  temporal modifiers that cannot be expressed either within <tt>value</tt> proper,
  or via links or temporal functions. Some examples: </p>

<pre>(4) no more than 60 days

&lt;TIMEX3 tid=&quot;t1&quot; type=&quot;DURATION&quot; value=&quot;P60D&quot; mod=&quot;EQUAL_OR_LESS&quot;&gt;
no more than 60 days
&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;

(5) the dawn of 2000

&lt;TIMEX3 tid=&quot;t2&quot; type=&quot;DATE&quot; value=&quot;2000&quot; mod=&quot;START&quot;&gt;
the dawn of 2000
&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;</pre>

<p><tt>anchorTimeID</tt> is used to point to another TIMEX3 in the case of expressions
  such as &quot;last week&quot;, which have a functional interpretation. The
  value of <tt>anchorTimeID</tt> provides the reference point to which the functional
  interpretation applies. </p>
<p><tt>quant</tt> and <tt>freq</tt> are used to specify sets that that denote
  quantified times in a TIMEX3. <tt>quant</tt> is generally a literal from the
  text that quantifies over the expression. <tt>freq</tt> contains an integer
  value and a time granularity to represent any frequency contained in the set,
  just as a period of time is represented in a duration. Some examples:</p>

<pre>(6) twice a month

&lt;TIMEX3 tid=&quot;t3&quot; type=&quot;SET&quot; value=&quot;P1M&quot; freq=&quot;2X&quot;&gt;
twice a month
&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;

(7) three days every month

&lt;TIMEX3 tid=&quot;t4&quot; type=&quot;SET&quot; value=&quot;P1M&quot; quant=&quot;EVERY&quot; freq=&quot;3D&quot;&gt;
three days every month
&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;

(8) daily

&lt;TIMEX3 tid=&quot;t5&quot; type=&quot;SET&quot; value=&quot;P1D quant=&quot;EVERY&quot;&gt;<br>daily
&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;</pre>

<p><tt>beginPoint</tt> and <tt>endpoint</tt> are used to anchor
  durations to other time expressions in the document. If there is no explicit <tt>tid</tt> to
  assign to one of these values, then an empty TIMEX3 tag is created to represent
  the unspecified point. Conversely, if both the beginning and end points of
  a duration are explicitly stated in the document, an empty TIMEX3 tag is created
  to represent the unspecified duration. Some examples:</p>

<pre>(9) two weeks from June 7, 2003

&lt;TIMEX3 tid=&quot;t6&quot; type=&quot;DURATION&quot; value=&quot;P2W&quot; beginPoint=&quot;t61&quot; endPoint=&quot;t62&quot;&gt;
two weeks
&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;
&lt;SIGNAL sid=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;
from
&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;
&lt;TIMEX3 tid=&quot;t61&quot; type=&quot;DATE&quot; value=&quot;2003-06-07&quot;&gt;

<p>SIGNAL is used to annotate sections of text, typically function words, that
  indicate how temporal objects are to be related to each other. The material
  marked by SIGNAL constitutes several types of linguistic elements: </p>
<ol>
  <li>indicators of temporal relations such as temporal prepositions (e.g &quot;on&quot;, &quot;during&quot;)
    and other temporal connectives (e.g. &quot;when&quot;) and subordinators
    (e.g. &quot;if&quot;). This functionality of the SIGNAL tag was introduced
    by Setzer (2001). </li>
  <li>indicators of temporal quantification such as &quot;twice&quot;, &quot;three
    times&quot;, etc. </li>
</ol>

<p><a name="tlink"></a></p>
<h3>2.5 &nbsp; &lt;TLINK&gt;</h3>

<p>TLINK is one of the three TimeML link tags. Link tags encode the various
  relations that exist between the temporal elements of a document. The motivations
for having multiple types of links are the following: </p>
<ol>
  <li>To distinguish between event types and
    event instances, such as those introduced by conjunction, quantification,
    or negation. </li>
  <li>To adequately handle subordinating contexts
    involving modality and reported speech. </li>
</ol>
<p>TLINK is a temporal link. It represents the relation between two temporal
  elements. </p>

  subordinates another event instance type. These are cases where a verb takes
  a complement and subordinates the event instance referred to in this complement.</p>

<h3>2.8 &nbsp; &lt;CONFIDENCE&gt;</h3>

<p>In various discussions of the full TERQAS groups, the utility of being able
  to mark confidence values for various aspects of the annotation was pointed
  out. In general, it would be useful to allow confidence values to be assigned
  to any tag, and, in fact, to any attribute of any tag. </p>
<p>A convenient way to do this would be to create a confidence tag, which would
  consume no input, and which would have the following attributes: </p>

<pre class="dtd">
attributes ::= tagType tagID [attributeName] confidenceValue [comment]

tagType ::= CDATA
tagID ::= IDREF
attributeName ::= CDATA
confidenceValue ::= CDATA
{confidenceValue ::= 0 &lt; x &lt; 1}
comment ::= CDATA
</pre>

<p>where </p>
<blockquote>
  <tt>tagType</tt> would range over the names of all the tags of TimeML<br>
  <tt>tagID</tt> would range over the set of actual tag IDs within the current document (XML type IDREF)<br>
  <tt>attributeName</tt> would range over the names of all the attributes of all the tags of TimeML<br>
<tt>confidenceValue</tt> would range over the rationals (i.e. would have a floating point value) between 0 and 1</blockquote>

<p>So, for example, given this annotation: </p>

  of &quot;crashlanded&quot; was really <tt>&quot;PAST&quot;</tt>, we could add
  this annotation:</p>

<pre class="dtd">(23'') &lt;CONFIDENCE tagType=&quot;EVENT&quot; tagID=&quot;e1&quot; attributeName=&quot;TENSE&quot; confidenceValue=&quot;0.75&quot;/&gt;</pre>

<p>Abstracting confidence measures as a separate tag frees the annotation from
  having to include a confidence value attribute in every tag and eliminates
  the problem of uncertainty over the exact attribute of a tag the confidence
  value applies to. </p>
<p>As for how confidence values should be assigned in manual annotation, we
  feel that, in a large-scale annotation effort such as TIMEBANK, two conditions
  should be satisfied: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Fairly high inter-annotator agreement on the tag assignment in the text. </li>
  <li>Ease of use and habitability of the tool from the annotator's perspective. </li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the annotation of a scalar value such as confidence should have
  at least two features: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The choice of confidence values should
    be as clearly defined as possible to cover the options; this relates to the
    granularity and orders of magnitude as presented by Jerry Hobbs as well.
    This would suggest a selection from a small set (e.g. low, mid, high; not_sure,
    sure, abolutely_sure). These could be interpreted or rescaled to a (0,1]
    range, if need be, for subsequent inference. </li>
  <li>There should be a default value specified
    (at high (=1)) so that it is not necessary to annotate all links and attributes
    for them with a confidence. </li>
</ul>
<p>The constraint on human annotators to a subset of the possible values should
  be documented in the annotation guidelines and implemented in the annotation
  tool. And it would probably be best if the annotation tool did not present
  numbers but rather natural language descriptions such as those suggested above,
  which would be represented in the underlying annotation numerically. For example,
  the annotator might pick &quot;moderately certain&quot;, which would enter
  the annotation as .5. </p>
<p>Moreover, for manual annotation, it does not seem that the 0 and 1 values
  will be used/useful. Presumably if the annotator doesn't trust an annotation
  at all s/he won't add it. And, as was suggested above, 1, at least for manual
  annotation, should be the default or unmarked value, and so need not be noted,
  since it would bulk up the files considerably, even if it were used only on
  entire tags. </p>

<h2>3 &nbsp; Changes from Version 1.2 to 1.2.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <tt>nf_morph</tt> attribute that was part of MAKEINSTANCE has been changed
to <tt>pos</tt> (part of speech), and the PRESPART, PASTPART, and INFINITIVE
elements of <tt>nf_morph</tt> redistributed to <tt>tense</tt>.</li>
<br>
<li>The optional <tt>syntax</tt> attribute was added to SLINK, ALINK, and
TLINK.  Syntax can be used to hold CDATA, but is generally only used by
annotation programs to hold the data that led to the creation of the tag.</li>
<br>
<li>The optional <tt>comment</tt> attribute was added to all TimeML elements,
for the purpose of giving (human) annotators a place to put observations about
annotated text.</li>
<br>

</ul>
